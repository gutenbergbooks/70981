</div>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> and again the world is stirred by a
discovery such as that of the Tomb of
Tutankhamen by Mr. Howard Carter and
Lord Carnarvon. In the following pages I have
sought to reveal some of the romance of excavation,
to tell the fascinating story of the men who have
gone out into the desert places and dug up long-lost
cities and the fabled treasure of ancient kings.
Brilliant men, who have played their part in unearthing
the glories of the past, have written many
volumes on the subject which is nearest their hearts,
and if, after closing this book, the reader and
student feel a desire to seek them out, I shall be
content. In conclusion, I wish to thank Major
Kenneth Mason, M.C., R.E., The British School
at Athens, and The Trustees of the British Museum,
for their kindness in allowing me to use various
illustrations in this volume.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">A scientist</span> stood in the British Museum
gazing at a piece of rock. Many people
passed to and fro, but never one halted
to see what held his attention, never one save a
little boy, who wondered what the grown-up was
looking at. Those who glanced in that direction
merely saw a shattered stone, and passed on unheeding.</p>

<p>Had the fragment of stone been the Cullinan
diamond or a glowing ruby, everybody would have
clustered round to gaze at it. As it was neither one
nor the other, everybody walked on. Yet that
fragment of stone was, and is, much more wonderful
than the finest diamond or ruby ever dug out of the
earth.</p>

<p>The fragment over which the scientist dreamed
was the Rosetta Stone. It is merely a piece of
black basalt 28½ inches wide and 45 inches in length.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
The top left corner has disappeared in the dust of
centuries, and both corners on the right side have
been smashed off. The remainder is one of the
world’s greatest treasures, for it has given us the
clue to the past, unfolded for us the romance of
ancient Egypt, and enabled us to glimpse the
Pharaohs in all their glory.</p>

<p>The Rosetta Stone is divided into three sections,
each of which is covered with writing cut into the
surface. The top section is composed of hieroglyphics,
the curious picture-writing of ancient Egypt,
the middle section is in the everyday writing of
the ordinary people of ancient Egypt, known as
demotic characters, and the bottom section is in
Greek.</p>

<p>This famous stone has travelled far from its
original resting-place in the Nile delta, where it
may have lain for close on two thousand years.
Had Napoleon not made up his mind to conquer
Egypt it might never have been recovered. By
chance, Napoleon managed to escape Nelson, who
was searching the Mediterranean for him, and
landed his expedition at Alexandria. Sweeping
everything before him, Bonaparte soon dominated
the country and despoiled the conquered people of
the relics of the past.</p>

<p>Then Nelson, coming back to look for his foe,
found the French fleet in Aboukir Bay, and swept
it for ever from the seas. Napoleon was shaken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
but hid his mortification, and in due course set off
to invade Syria. Gazah, of Biblical history, fell
before him, Jaffa was captured, but at Acre another
British Admiral, Sir Sydney Smith, intervened.
The French ships sailing along the coast with stores
for Napoleon’s troops were captured, and the
British sailor then threw himself heart and soul
into the defence of the city. Napoleon fought
desperately for weeks to capture Acre, but the
Admiral was his match, and the French forces were
at last compelled to retreat.</p>

<p>About this time a sapper was digging away in
the ruins of Fort St. Julian when his pick struck
against a rock. He drove the tool into the soil
to see if the rock were large or small, and whether
it would be difficult to remove. He quickly discovered
that the rock was of no great size, and in
a few minutes it was lying clear at the bottom of
the trench.</p>

<p>Glancing idly at the stone, the Frenchman
noticed it was covered with strange characters.
The soldier was quite interested in his find, so
interested that he cleaned the whole surface of
the strange stone he had unearthed. That the
characters were some sort of writing was obvious,
but what it was all about was much more than
he could tell. Other men might have thrown the
stone aside and covered it up again, but fortunately
the finder possessed intelligence and the curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
stone was added to the rest of the booty collected
by the French.</p>

<p>That stone, unearthed in 1798, was the piece of
black basalt which is now to be seen at the British
Museum in London. It became known as the
Rosetta Stone because it was found near Rosetta,
the seaport whence Napoleon eventually fled from
Egypt, and when the French were defeated it
passed into our possession as one of the spoils of
war.</p>

<p>It seems strange that two of the greatest figures
in history, Nelson and Napoleon, should be connected
with the discovery of the Rosetta Stone.
Stranger still to think what might have happened
had the soldier who found the stone smashed it
to pieces or tossed it out of the way. These
things might easily have occurred, as they have
no doubt occurred to many valuable relics in
bygone times.</p>

<p>Had the Rosetta Stone not come to light, one
of the vital links with Egypt’s past would have
been missing. We might still be groping in the
dark, wondering what all the quaint picture-writing
of the Egyptians meant, seeking for the clue that
would tell us. Luckily the man who found the
stone saw that it was something more than a
broken piece of rock, and so preserved it for posterity.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>Many people wondered what all the strange
signs meant when they first saw the stone. Men of
science pored over it and racked their brains in
their efforts to solve the mystery. The Greek
script was soon translated, and proved to be a
decree of Ptolemy V, dating about 196 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The fact that there were three inscriptions seemed
to indicate that it was one decree engraved in three
different forms of writing in order to appeal to as
many people as possible. But this was by no
means certain. It might easily have been three
different decrees, though in such a case no purpose
could have been served by inscribing them
all on one stone. It was, therefore, more than
probable that the three inscriptions were one
decree, and that the known writing would give
a clue to the weird pictures to be found in the
tombs and on the monuments scattered about
Egypt.</p>

<p>The hieroglyphics were a mystery of the past.
No one could read them. The strange pictures
of men and birds and beasts might have been
merely decorative. They might have had no
meaning at all, or no more meaning than the
pictures we place on our walls to decorate our
houses.</p>

<p>Other signs, however, in combination with the
pictures, indicated that the hieroglyphics were a
form of writing. Some people think that this
picture-writing of the Egyptians is actually the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
oldest writing in the world, and that all writings
must have sprung from it. This idea, however, is
not quite accurate. A child of three years old
cannot draw wonderful portraits. Childish drawings
of a house with four straight lines for the house,
a door in the centre, and a window on each side of
the door are well known.</p>

<p>Man in the beginning may be likened to the child,
and his earliest drawings must have been cruder
than the childish drawings of our own age, far
cruder than anything that is preserved for us. The
first man to scratch a rough line or two on a rock
was the forefather of Raphael and Michael Angelo
and Rembrandt, but untold ages elapsed before the
art of the first primitive artist developed into that
of these masters.</p>

<p>The Egyptian pictures in the picture-writing are
cleverly drawn, and indicate true artistic perceptions.
It must have taken a long time to reach
the pitch of perfection that is shown. So it seems
logical to assume that the hieroglyphics were the
outcome of another form of writing. For years
there were no proofs that this was the case, but
it is now definitely established by Professor
Flinders Petrie that crude signs were used in
Egypt at a much earlier date than the picture-writing,
and the extraordinary thing is that some
of these signs may be traced in the alphabets
of other countries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>An English medical man, Dr. Young, was the first
to furnish a clue to the mystery of the Rosetta Stone.
Happening to take a keen interest in dead languages
as well as in living people, he saw among the
hieroglyphics two sets of signs with a line drawn
round them, and as the name of Ptolemy was twice
mentioned in the Greek text he reasoned that these
signs stood for the name of the ruler who made the
decree. He reasoned correctly, and we learned in
time that a king’s name was always enclosed in
a panel, which is now generally known as a
cartouche.</p>

<p>The deciphering of the king’s name was a happy
discovery which pointed to the general significance
of the cartouche in connection with royal names.
But the deciphering of the rest of the hieroglyphics
bristled with difficulties. No one knew
whether the signs stood for sounds, letters, words
or things.</p>

<p>Egyptians had painted these puzzling pictures,
but there was not a single man in all Egypt who
knew what they meant. The oldest Egyptian
peasant was ignorant on the subject, the most
learned Egyptian scholar had not the faintest idea
of their meaning. The Egyptians had forgotten
how to read the writing of their forefathers. It
was the writing of a dead age, of a vanished
civilization.</p>

<p>Dr. Young threw himself enthusiastically into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
the task of deciphering the signs. The difficulty
seemed to add a zest to his search. He pored over
the copy of the writing on the Rosetta Stone day
after day. There was absolutely nothing to guide
him. Everything was sheer deduction at first,
and then his deductions had to be tested and
verified.</p>

<p>So difficult was his task that the discovery of a
single letter was an event. Perhaps by great good
fortune he would succeed in deciphering two signs
in a week, then for a month he might study
the copy until his brain reeled, and decipher
nothing at all. It was a heart-breaking undertaking.
On one occasion he announced that he
had succeeded in translating a certain set of
hieroglyphics into a word of seven or eight
letters. It was afterwards proved that he was
right in only one letter, and that the rest were
hopelessly wrong.</p>

<p>He began on his project in 1814 and, after
struggling with it for four years, the sum total of
his labours amounted to the deciphering of just over
ninety characters. His discovery thus averaged
fewer than twenty-five signs a year. It meant
that he had to concentrate all the power of
his exceptional brain, and all his knowledge of
languages, for a whole month to decipher two
characters. In doing what he did, he accomplished
an astounding feat. It is impossible to praise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
Young too highly for his early work on the
Rosetta Stone.</p>

<p>At the same time that Young was wrestling with
hieroglyphics in England, François Champollion
was trying to solve the puzzle in France. Champollion’s
interest in hieroglyphics did not spring
up in a night; it was of slow growth, starting in his
childhood when Egypt bulked large in the imaginations
of most French boys owing to the stirring
deeds of Napoleon against the Mamelukes. By
the time Champollion was eleven years old, he was
already taking more than an ordinary boyish
interest in things Egyptian, and, as the years passed,
he slowly gathered books and material bearing on
the subject which he was to make peculiarly his
own.</p>

<p>He was eager, anxious, to decipher hieroglyphics.
It was the ambition of his life, the thing for which
he lived, of which he dreamed. He collected every
copy of the strange picture-writing that he could
find in order to study it, in the hope of deciphering
one more character. He was terribly handicapped
by the small quantity of material on which he could
work, and while his brilliant contemporary Young
lay dying in England, in 1829, Champollion was
leading an expedition in Egypt, gathering material
for France.</p>

<p>Champollion found the picture-writing even
more complex than any one anticipated. A single<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
letter might be represented by seven or eight quite
different signs, and a sign might represent a whole
word or part of a word. A circle with lines radiating
from it might represent the sun god, or it might
stand for the word “day.” A sign which ordinarily
stood for a letter might represent a god if a dot
or some other sign came after it.</p>

<p>The Egyptian hieroglyphics were indeed one of
the greatest puzzles of the ages. The discovery of
other inscriptions helped to verify Champollion’s
work, and provide proof that he was deciphering
the signs accurately. It is, nevertheless, incredible
that any human being could read even a sign of
this dead writing correctly. That any one could
do what Champollion ultimately did is almost a
miracle. He laboured at his self-appointed task
with so much courage and determination that he
eventually succeeded in building up a hieroglyphic
dictionary—a marvellous feat.</p>

<p>Champollion himself did not long survive Young,
for he so sapped his strength over his Egyptian
expedition that he fell ill and died in 1832. He
was comparatively a young man, only forty-two,
yet he crowded an enormous amount of work into
these few years, and it may truly be said that his
love of Egyptology cost him his life.</p>

<p>By the aid of his dictionary, which grew directly
out of the finding of the Rosetta Stone, our
scholars are now able to read without much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
trouble the sacred writings of the ancient Egyptians.
Thus that fragment of black basalt in the British
Museum, which is passed unnoticed by so many
people, is really one of the most interesting stones
in the world.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">A little</span> over a century ago the past of
Egypt was concealed from living eyes.
The Pyramids still stood four-square to
the sandstorms of the desert as they had stood for
ages, the Sphinx regarded the Nile with the same
inscrutable gaze that had puzzled the ancients.
Throughout Egypt were mighty ruins, but little
was known about them.</p>

<p>People used to sit astride their asses and jog
along into the stony places to see the relics. They
saw merely heaps of stones, buildings grown so old
that they had toppled to pieces. There were
broken statues and shattered columns lying in the
utmost confusion. There were mountains of sand,
with fragments of masonry protruding. Occasionally,
amid the shifting sands, a few columns stood
upright, some so strangely shaped that their like
was not to be seen elsewhere on earth.</p>

<p>They added to the general mystery of Egypt.
The natives were poor, utterly incapable of building
on such a gigantic scale. How, then, did the
original buildings get there? By whom were they
erected, and for what purpose?</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>Most people asked many questions, and received
different answers. The myths of the natives are
as numerous as the broken monuments, but,
whereas the broken stones are facts, the myths
woven round them were often otherwise. Any
fanciful story that served to win money from the
traveller was repeated in a variety of ways, and
any little truth there may have been originally
was lost in continued repetition.</p>

<p>The ruins, however, could not lie. They said,
as plainly as stones can speak: “We were fashioned
by Man in the long ago, and the sun shone on us
in our glory just as it shines on us in our decay.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, all men did not merely look at the
ruins and pass on their way voicing their amazement.
Some were so fascinated by what they saw
that they could not leave it, and these are gradually
unfolding to us one of the most romantic stories
in the world, a romance beside which the Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire is but a single
chapter.</p>

<p>The spoils collected in Egypt during the time of
Napoleon turned the attention of scientists to the
Nile. Men began to work to see if they could
unravel the past from the evidence afforded by the
remains. They began to dig. And, to-day, in the
arid places of the earth are many men toiling like
navvies, suffering untold discomforts, living in huts
and delving in ruins to add to our knowledge of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
the past. These are the men who are writing
history. They are doing it not with a pen, but
with spade and pick.</p>

<p>People have eyes, yet they see so little. They
are not trained to see. To most men a rose is
only a flower, but to the exceptional man it is a
miracle, for as he gazes at the glorious bloom with
its many-tinted petals he visualizes the tiny single
rose—the common dog-rose—from which all roses
in their wondrous diversity of colour and shape
and size and perfume have sprung. Many people
regard the earthworm as an annoyance which disfigures
the lawn, but Darwin saw in it the lowly
creature that is helping to keep the earth sweet
and clean by removing the decaying leaves, a
blind thing that is continually providing the earth
with a layer of new soil in which man may plant
his seeds and harvest his crops. Countless earthworms
are the servants of men.</p>

<p>The diggers toiling in the heat of the sun in
Egypt and Mesopotamia and Crete and other places
are blessed with this keen vision. Without it they
would be useless. If the Rosetta Stone to them
were just a broken piece of rock, the romance of
the past would not appeal to them. They would
not possess the imagination which drives them
into the lonely places to find traces of many lost
civilizations.</p>

<p>When they glimpse a ruin they can close their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
eyes and see the men quarrying the stones and the
masons squaring them and the sculptors carving
them; they can see kings consulting their architects,
and architects giving orders to the masons; they
can see the stone blocks being hauled in place and
set one upon another. These and many other
things they can see. They are using their eyes to
benefit the majority of people, who cannot see these
things for themselves.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the men who were early interested
in the past of Egypt had little to guide them, and
they sought for written records. They were all
papyri mad. So long as they could find papyri and
carry them off to their museums they were content.</p>

<p>In the light of our later knowledge we are wont
to blame them, but there may be some excuse for
them. The Egyptian papyri are wonderful, quite
apart from what is written upon them. They are
the gift of the Nile and of Egypt to the world.
Almost they might be called the first sheets of
paper ever made.</p>

<p>Papyrus nearly six thousand years old has already
been found, and it appears doubtful whether we
shall ever be able to trace the name of the first man
who thought of using the stem of the papyrus plant
in so useful a manner.</p>

<p>It seems likely that the discovery may have been
due to Egyptian children. If you walk about the
English country-side when the bulrushes are flourishing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
it is a common sight to see children plucking
the rushes and skinning them to make flowers out
of the pith. The papyrus plant flourishes in the
Nile water, where it roots in the mud just as the
bulrush roots in the mud of English ponds. It
often attains a height of 15 feet or more, and the
green stem of the plant grows straight up without
any joints from top to bottom.</p>

<p>What children do in one country in one age they
are likely to do in all countries in all ages. Human
nature is fairly constant, and rushes growing in a
river will always attract children. Probably some
dark-skinned Egyptian children in the misty ages
picked the skin off the papyrus reeds in order to
play with the pith, which differs materially from
that of the English bulrush. In the course of their
childish games they may have cut the fibrous pith
into layers and spread them on a rock, just as
children spread out things to play at shops, whereupon
the hot sun of Egypt would quickly dry the
fragments.</p>

<p>Perhaps the father, interested in the games of his
children, seized on this curious substance and was
struck by its fine texture and smooth surface.
Experimenting for himself out of sheer curiosity,
he may have cut some strips of pith and joined
them in a simple manner by pressing the edges
with his finger while they were still moist with
sap, thus making the first sheet of papyrus. Whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
its origin, papyrus in time was made by
cutting the pith into thin strips, placing the strips
so that one edge overlapped another, and pressing
them all together. When they dried, the overlapped
edges adhered, and the result was a continuous
sheet of white material on which it was
possible to work with a brush and a reed pen.</p>

<p>The papyrus reed still flourishes in the Upper
Nile as it did in ancient days. Indeed it has become
rather a curse to the country, and a few years ago
it threatened to choke the river completely. It
was such a menace, owing to its interfering with
the flow of water on which the whole life of Egypt
depends, that drastic steps, costing a huge sum of
money, had to be taken to clear the upper reaches.
Steamers slowly ate their way into it for hundreds
of miles, clearing channels and destroying the sudd,
as it is called, the sudd which is largely composed of
the papyrus on which the ancients relied for their
writing materials! Nowadays, the sudd is being
compressed into blocks and used as fuel, so the
papyrus is still serving humanity.</p>

<p>As has been said, the early workers who sought
for knowledge of old Egypt hunted mainly for
papyri. Manuscripts were of undoubted value in
throwing light on the past, and while the seekers
were prepared to recover statues, jewels and similar
objects, they placed the recovery of manuscripts
before everything else. The fact that they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
not read the papyri, in those early days when a
glimmer of interest in Egypt was beginning to
filter through to the outside world, was no drawback
to the hunters. The rows of quaint pictures,
with bird-headed men, the natives with mops of
black hair, and other queer things, were attractive
in themselves. They had a value to the collector
for their strange writing alone. And those early
collectors realized that, given the manuscripts,
some brilliant men would manage to read them some
day, as Young and Champollion actually did.</p>

<p>So those early enthusiasts spent their time
hunting tombs, digging here, there and everywhere
in their endeavours to locate something that was
worth carrying away. When they were successful
they seized on the mummy cases and eagerly opened
them to see if any manuscripts were inside with the
mummy. In their eagerness they overlooked much.
They searched haphazard. Their knowledge was
small, and they undoubtedly cast aside many things
which they looked upon as so much rubbish, trifles
which to the scientist of to-day would light up the
past as with a searchlight.</p>

<p>A square inch of broken pottery is not particularly
noticeable in a mound of rock and sand, and even if
the eye does light on it the hand is seldom prompted
to pick it up. But there are men so skilled in their
knowledge of the pottery of past ages that a fragment
may serve to link places thousands of miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
apart, and thrust the history of mankind backward
into the mists of time for several thousands of
years.</p>

<p>A brilliant scientist like Professor Flinders Petrie
is able to deduce the most amazing things from a
piece of pottery, even if it be but a fragment. To
him the fragment serves the purpose of a calendar.
It is as though he were picking up a modern calendar
on which the year stood boldly out. Of course the
fragment of pottery does not date quite so exactly
as that, but it easily falls within a well-defined
period.</p>

<p>A glance would enable the famous scientist to
say: “This is seven thousand years old.” And,
seeing a different fragment, he would know that
it was a great deal older—perhaps ten thousand
years old.</p>

<p>How much valuable evidence of this sort has
been ignorantly destroyed in the past will never
be known. In the early days of last century, and
even to within measurable distance of this, men
were too intent on the big things to pay attention
to the little things that slipped through their fingers.
It is the common things that tell us the history of
a period, the things that people use and wear. If
we recover these fragments of common things, they
serve to indicate how the people lived.</p>

<p>Thieves, too, have been responsible for the loss
of most valuable evidence. The Egyptian natives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
are born pilferers. They have a natural aptitude
for causing things to vanish, and when a discovery
has been made the discoverer has seldom been
able to preserve his find in its entirety. There have
been cases where the greater part of a find has
disappeared in a night, and once it is gone you
might as well seek to find a particular grain of sand
in the desert. Statues, vases, jewels, furniture—all
have been carried off, and the finders have
wakened to discover that their labour has been
wasted, and that instead of enriching our knowledge
of the world they have merely enriched a few native
thieves.</p>

<p>The natives, too, often seize the opportunity of
digging in places where they know they will not
be disturbed. They do not go to the trouble of
obtaining a permit to dig. The last thing they
desire to do is to call the attention of the authorities
to their work, so they run the risk and dig surreptitiously.
While it is obvious they must waste
a lot of energy in conducting these illegal searches,
it is also obvious that they are often rewarded by
finding objects of value.</p>

<p>The things they find, they smuggle to their huts,
and in due course sell to some traveller, who places
them in his private collection, where they are as
completely lost to sight as if they had never existed.
Then there are things that the natives stumble on
accidentally. If their find is not portable, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
may inform the authorities, but if it is easy to
handle, there is little prospect of their discovery
becoming known.</p>

<p>No one has the faintest idea how much material
has been lost in these ways. Its scientific value
must be incalculable.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Professor Flinders Petrie first set
foot in Egypt he was a young man,
only twenty-seven years of age. The
older men of other nations who had spent their
lives delving in the past smiled at the idea of
the new-comer bringing about a revolution in the
work they knew so well. They had done so much
themselves that there seemed little more for him
to do. They had found tombs and statues and
papyri that took them back some five thousand
years to what they thought was the beginning of
Egyptian history.</p>

<p>What else was there to discover?</p>

<p>Nobody knew then. Nobody knows now. When
men start digging up the earth in search of relics
of the past, it is beyond human foresight to foretell
what will come to light. Men may dig 50 feet and
find nothing. They may say there is nothing to be
found in that particular spot. Another man may
come along, set up his tent a few yards away, just
scratch the surface of the soil, and find a buried
city. This is what lures men to the work; it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
one of the fascinations and provides much of the
romance.</p>

<p>The wonderful discovery of the tomb of King
Tutankhamen by Lord Carnarvon and Mr. Howard
Carter is a notable instance of this sort of thing.
For years they dug, poured money into the sands
of the desert, shifting mountains of sand and rock
in their endeavours to discover something worth
while. Lord Carnarvon himself stated that they
had moved about 70,000 tons of rubble during their
search. They were lucky to be rewarded in the
end, for millions of tons of rock and sand have
been dug up in Egypt without yielding to the
diggers a single article of value.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard Carter was hopeful that something
might be found in the neighbourhood of the great
discovery, and the work of excavation was started.
The diggers wielded their picks week after week
and shovelled the rubble into the baskets of the
men who carried it away from the hole that was
growing in the ground. Daily the hole grew bigger,
the mound of sand and rock grew larger.</p>

<p>Not a sign of a tomb was discovered. Work was
continued in the hope that something would turn
up. They were always hopeful, but the end of
the day brought nothing to light and it proved so
much wasted labour.</p>

<p>The quest in the old place was thrown up, and
the picks of the diggers were directed to a spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
only a few yards away. There was the same
monotonous, back-aching work, the same running
to and fro of the natives with their little
baskets of rubble. In such circumstances only
a born optimist could carry on. The pessimist
would throw up the task in despair at the end
of two or three days.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Howard Carter began to think that he
had again drawn a blank; he began to consider
whether it was time to shut down operations and
have another try elsewhere. For a day or two his
thoughts ran in this groove, until he decided to dig
just one more day, and if nothing turned up then
to stop it.</p>

<p>Truly a momentous decision. But for it the
tomb of Tutankhamen would still be undiscovered,
and the world would yet be in ignorance of the
marvels that it contained. Before the day’s digging
was over, the shape of a step gladdened Mr. Carter’s
eyes, and fully justified his selection of that particular
spot for his operations. A yard or two
more to the right or left, and he might have missed
the tomb. It was a much nearer thing than the
world imagines.</p>

<p>The accuracy of Mr. Howard Carter in selecting
his second site is rather amazing. Digging was
not started there haphazard. The ground had
been thoroughly gone over and studied, and the
possibilities summed up before the pick was driven
into the sand. It was a happy combination of
expert knowledge and good luck.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>It at once became obvious why the tomb had
remained for so long undiscovered, for just above
it the last resting-place of Thothmes <span class="allsmcap">III</span> was cut into
the rock, and all the debris from this later tomb
had been shot by the builders on top of the earlier
tomb. This rubbish had completely covered in
the site of the tomb of Tutankhamen and buried
it for centuries.</p>

<p>Few men would think of looking immediately
under one tomb for the site of another. Such a
place is so unexpected that Mr. Howard Carter
deserved every credit for selecting so unlikely a spot
in which to carry on his search.</p>

<p>Every man digging in Egypt has learned something
from Professor Flinders Petrie. He has a
keen, analytical brain, and for years before going
to the Nile valley he brought his acute mind to
the study of the prehistoric remains to be found in
Great Britain. Many a day he might have been
seen within the magic circle of Stonehenge, pondering
on the origin of the most massive ancient
monument in England. His work on the prehistoric
remains in Great Britain was but a
preliminary to his greater work in the land of
the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>With the coming of Flinders Petrie, all the old,
haphazard methods went by the board. What he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
sought was evidence, something that would throw
light on the past, that would help to fix dates.
The actual intrinsic value of an object was of no
concern to him. A bead, in his eyes, found in a
certain place, would be of greater value than a
nugget of gold. The bead might prove that glass
was made centuries earlier than men thought,
whereas the golden nugget might prove nothing
at all.</p>

<p>Many things slipped through the fingers of the
earlier seekers. Nothing slipped through his. He
directed the attention of all to the value of every
trifling thing that could claim to have been fashioned
by the hand of man. He introduced scientific
methods. He noted where everything was found;
how it was found; the depth at which it was found;
what was found with it.</p>

<p>He was not out for an easy life. He lived hard,
pitched his tent on the edge of the eternal desert,
and at dusk washed the dust out of his eyes and
nostrils, took his meal by his camp fire, and wrote
up the notes of his day’s work. He snatched what
sleep he could, and was up early to get to work
before the heat of the day became insufferable.
He wasted no time going to and from the site. He
slept near by, with the scene of his labours only a
few yards from his tent pegs.</p>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>Flinders Petrie is one of the outstanding explorers
of the ruins of Egypt. He started with an innate
genius for the work, and to this genius he added
a sound scientific knowledge and an all-round
mastery of his subject. He used his muscles as
well as his brain, and he preferred to trust his own
trained eyes to those of his native diggers.</p>

<p>He went to Egypt with hands that were soft,
unused to manual labour. He knew how often
careless workmen have ruined things by striking
them with their picks, and the first thing he did was
to make a rule that directly anything peeped out
of the sand, he would himself uncover the object to
prevent it being injured.</p>

<p>He began tracing the contours of the things in
the soil, digging away with his fingers and scratching
away with his nails, his hands perhaps buried up
to the wrist in sand. Thus he would clear an object
a little at a time, so carefully that it could not
possibly suffer damage.</p>

<p>But his hands were not made for such work.
Finger-nails of steel and a skin of tanned leather
were needed to grub about in the sands of the desert.
No wonder that his fingers became frightfully sore
and tender, that his nails were almost worn away
by continual contact with the sand. That was one
of the minor hardships of such work, a discomfort
that he treated lightly.</p>

<p>The soreness of his hands did not prevent him
from using them as digging implements, and in a
week or two he was having a personal lesson in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
evolution. Soft hands were useless to him in such
a task. So nature quickly readjusted itself to the
different circumstances and evolved hard hands
for him, toughened the skin of the palms and
back and tempered the finger-nails until he could
rummage about all day in the sand with absolute
impunity, running no more risk of injuring
his fingers than if he were actually wearing thick
leather gloves.</p>

<p>When he turned his attention to Abydos in
Southern Egypt, he found a Frenchman had been
granted the privilege of exploring the spot.
Amelineau was installed at Abydos. He had dug
away for four years, finding tombs and exploring
them, and adding a little to the sum total of the
knowledge of Egypt.</p>

<p>The Egyptian Government gave Amelineau a
five years’ concession, and at the end of the fourth
year’s work he surveyed the site. He went over it,
looked at the mountains of rubbish his diggers had
shifted, summed up his discoveries, and at last
concluded that it was useless digging there any
longer. He decided that he had explored the
place thoroughly, and had found all that existed
there.</p>

<p>Not one man in a thousand would have thought
it worth while to look for anything at Abydos after
that. Apparently the field had been thoroughly
explored and worked out. But Flinders Petrie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
happened to be the one man who thought otherwise.
While he respected the opinion of the Frenchman,
he yet felt that here was a field for further investigation,
that Abydos had not yielded up all its
secrets to the previous seekers.</p>

<p>So he set his diggers to work. He went over the
ground systematically, digging away, picking over
and casting aside the debris. His sharp eyes
detected things to which previous eyes had been
blind. He found pots that were not turned on the
potter’s wheel, pots made before the potter’s wheel
had been invented. These pots were shaped solely
by hand, fashioned from the bottom upward, and
they were almost as true in form as if they had
been turned on a wheel.</p>

<p>He was hot on the scent, turning back the wheels
of time. He found the hitherto unknown names
of four of the ancient kings of Egypt, the first men
who could lay claim to rule the tribes, the men
who figure before the first Dynasty. He was
pushing civilization back, and yet farther back.
Whereas others set the limit of the civilization
of Egypt as five thousand years, he added another
fifty centuries to it, doubled the life of the civilization
that flourished and decayed and flourished
and decayed many times in the valley of the
Nile.</p>

<p>Came a day when his eyes lit up at the
unusual in a piece of pottery, not that it was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
wondrously beautiful, but because the markings
on it linked it up with Crete far away to the north
in the middle of the Mediterranean, proving that
intercourse existed between the two peoples in
those dim ages.</p>

<p>The native diggers cast casual glances at the
jar. They were not particularly interested. To
them it was merely an ordinary piece of pottery.</p>

<p>If that same piece of earthenware were placed
in a china shop in London to-day with the rest
of the oddments of china, and marked at five shillings,
no one would trouble to buy it, unless by
chance he possessed expert knowledge.</p>

<p>It seems remarkable that this piece of pottery,
so fragile that a moderate blow would shatter it,
should have survived for all these thousands of
years. The ancient potter who shaped the soft
clay and baked it until it was hard was indeed
working for posterity. He little knew, as the jar
grew under his nimble fingers, how many centuries
would elapse and find it still as perfect as when
he took it from the fire; nor could he guess
how much his little jar, which he moulded so
cunningly, would tell to the brilliant man who
found it.</p>

<p>Fate ordained that his handiwork should be
buried in a grave, and there remain in absolute
security until the centuries brought the right man
along to unearth it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>It was but a Cretan pot in an Egyptian grave,
but that little pot for a time made scholars wonder
whether the civilization of Egypt was founded on
a far older civilization which came from Crete, the
little island in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">The</span> men who are digging history out of
the earth with pick and shovel rely upon
something more than chance to obtain
their results. The general idea of a man casually
strolling out into the desert, and uncovering a city
which has never been heard of, has little relation
to the facts. It would be just as reasonable to start
fishing for Japanese pearls in the middle of the
Atlantic Ocean, as to start blindly digging through
the sands of Egypt in the hope that something
would turn up.</p>

<p>Ancient monuments, papyri and wall-paintings,
even the legends of the country, are carefully
considered with a view to finding a clue to the
past. The sites of the ancient tombs and palaces
and cities have gradually been located, and the
explorers naturally select a spot which holds out
some prospect of success. They generally have a
definite object in view when they start their search.
For instance, Lord Carnarvon and Mr. Howard
Carter were hoping to find another tomb when
they came across that of Tutankhamen. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
Maspero made his discovery of so many of the
Pharaohs about forty years ago, the mummy of
Tutankhamen was missing, and there was accordingly
the possibility that some diligent man might
eventually unearth it.</p>

<p>For forty years the search went on. Other
tombs were found, but that of Tutankhamen
still eluded discovery, until the autumn of 1922.
The digger always has hopes of finding a certain
thing, but as often as not he comes across something
else.</p>

<p>Before a pick is stuck into the ground, the digger
will spend several days on the spot, going over it
carefully, and noting any irregularities. Long
experience teaches him many things. What the
ordinary man cannot see, even when it is pointed
out to him, may be quite plain to the trained eye.
A slight depression may indicate to the expert
the site of a buried building, a tiny bank may tell
him where the sand of the desert has blown against
a wall and gradually accumulated until the wall
is covered beneath the drift. It is invisible, but
there is the slight slope to prove that the sand
has been heaped against something, to show that
its path has been stayed by some object. These
are some of the things which help the experts
to select the spot on which to dig. The man who
prospects for gold knows what signs to look for,
and the scientist prospecting for relics of past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
ages is equally proficient in reading the signs.
The gold prospector digs a hole, and washes the
contents to find a colour of gold; the seeker for
relics prospects by digging a trench to see if he
can find a bit of brick or stone showing traces of
man’s handiwork.</p>

<p>Egypt happens to be a particularly happy
hunting-ground, inasmuch as it not only possessed
an extremely ancient civilization, but
also enjoys a wonderful climate, which preserves
the relics of the past. The sun is always shining,
and rain falls so seldom that things are preserved
almost indefinitely from damp and mildew where
in other countries they are destroyed in a few
years.</p>

<p>The ancient cities of Egypt were founded on the
banks of the Nile, just as are the modern cities.
Away from the river, life is insupportable. It has
often been said that the Nile is Egypt, and Egypt
is the Nile. This is true, for the cultivable land of
Egypt above the Delta is just a green strip a mile
or two wide on each side of the river all along its
course. On the margin is the encroaching desert,
which only the waters of the Nile prevent from
overwhelming the land. Where the waters of the
Nile flow into the little irrigation canals and feed
the fields, there abundant crops of cotton, sugar-cane,
and other things are raised. Beyond, are the
arid hills, and the cruel sands where the rock in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
summer becomes so hot that it is possible to bake
bread by the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>The people living in lands that are blessed with
an adequate rainfall can have no conception of
what the Nile means to Egypt. The drought
which occasionally affects our own country brings
home to us the importance of rain to the land. Our
whole country-side soon begins to complain about
lack of water. Wells begin to run dry. Water has
even to be carried to some villages by train.</p>

<p>A traveller spent a night at an old inn on the
Sussex downs, and found an inch of chalk sediment
at the bottom of his small jug of shaving water in
the morning. Crops which should have been
4 feet high had struggled up only a few inches.
There was no moisture to help them to develop.
Fields of heavy land were all ploughed up, but
before the farmer could harrow them and prepare
a fine tilth for the seeds, the clods were baked as
hard as iron, so hard that it was impossible to do
anything with them, and the fields carried no crops
at all. A succession of such seasons would have
a profound effect on the life of this country, and
compel our people to live where water could be
obtained.</p>

<p>That is why the Egyptians were—and are—chained
to the Nile. The floods fed the land.
When the river failed to rise, and the water was
confined within the banks, there was famine. No<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
wonder those ancient Egyptians worshipped the
Nile. Their lives depended on it.</p>

<p>They watched the river anxiously to see what it
was going to do, scanning the chocolate-coloured
waters as they went flowing by. They wondered
whether the river was going to condemn them to
starvation, or whether it was about to scatter plenty
over the land. Far away from Cairo, up at Khartoum,
the rise began about the end of April, but
so great is the distance that no perceptible
increase was to be noticed at Cairo until the end
of June.</p>

<p>As the water rose, so did the spirits of the natives.
We can imagine with what joy they saw the flood
break over the banks and sweep into the fields on
either side. Stone pillars were put up to measure
the rise. They were marked off in cubits, and the
officials would watch the water stealing up and
up. If it only reached 12 cubits there would be
wailing throughout the land, for the people knew
that famine would overtake them, that the life-giving
water would not reach their fields. Another
3 cubits would suffice to feed them until the next
harvest came round, if they exercised care and were
not unduly wasteful, while 16 cubits, or 28 feet, would
fill their granaries to overflowing, and every one
would have enough and to spare.</p>

<br>

<p>They prayed long and earnestly to the Nile god,
and held great festivals in his honour in a temple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>built in the vanished city of Nilopolis. Here they
performed their rituals and made their offerings,
and gave thanks to the god in years of plenty,
expressing their joy and gratitude for the bounty
they had received. They worshipped the Nile as
the source of their blessings, just as they worshipped
the sun.</p>

<p>The sun worshippers built a magnificent temple
to their god, whom they called Ra, at Heliopolis,
and Cleopatra’s Needle, now standing on the
Thames Embankment, is one of the two monuments
which Thothmes <span class="allsmcap">III</span> set up before the Temple of the
Sun on the banks of the Nile. Here they remained
until the legions of Augustus Cæsar defeated Cleopatra
just before the dawn of the Christian era.
Eight years after the dramatic death of the
beautiful Egyptian queen, whom Julius Cæsar
loved and Mark Antony worshipped, Augustus
set his engineers and slaves to work transporting
the obelisks down the Nile, to set them in front of
the wonderful palace of the Cæsars built in Alexandria.
The new palace of the Roman invaders
grew old, decayed, and fell in ruins, but the ancient
obelisks of Heliopolis still reared their pinnacles to
the skies. For fifteen hundred years Cleopatra’s
Needle stood firm before crashing to the ground,
to lie half buried in the drifting sands for
three centuries, leaving the twin obelisk standing
alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Then British soldiers, flushed with their victory
over the French in Egypt in 1801, craved a memento
of their triumph. Seizing on the fallen obelisk,
they subscribed their hard-earned money, and
sought to remove the stone to England. That
weight was too much for them; it defied their
efforts, so, fixing a commemorative brass plate,
they left the stone lying in the sands.</p>

<p>Mehemet Ali, knowing the British were interested
in the obelisk, presented it to George <span class="allsmcap">IV</span>. That
monarch made no effort to remove the unwieldy
present. Once more, in 1831, Mehemet Ali approached
the British Government, and this time
offered to ship the monument free to Great Britain.
The offer was politely declined. By the time the
British Government decided to remove the stone,
in 1849, there was such opposition to spending
£7000 on its removal, that the matter was
dropped.</p>

<p>Eighteen years later, the land on which the monolith
lay was sold, and the new owner quickly requested
the British Government to remove their
property. The Government were so loath to do
anything at all that the Khedive informed them
they must either remove it, or forfeit the title
to it. The threat had no effect. The Government
seemed to look upon the present much as a
suburban dweller would look upon the present of
an elephant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>The owner of the land began to plan to
break up the obelisk, and use it for building
purposes. For ten years all the efforts of General
Alexander were needed to induce the landowner
to refrain from such an act of vandalism, and
at last, when it was seen that the Government
would do nothing, Sir Erasmus Wilson came
forward and offered to remove the obelisk to
England.</p>

<p>Accordingly a mighty iron cylinder 100 feet
long was made. The obelisk, which measures
86½ feet high, and weighs 186 tons, was dug out
of the sand, and after tremendous trouble safely
housed in the cylinder, which, upon being completely
sealed, was quite buoyant. Eventually
it was floated, and taken in tow for England. All
went well until the Bay of Biscay was reached,
when a terrific gale sprang up, so terrific that
Cleopatra’s Needle threatened to drag the tug to
the bottom. At midnight the situation became so
desperate that the captain ordered the obelisk to
be cut adrift, feeling certain it was sinking, and
when he arrived in England Cleopatra’s Needle
was given up for lost.</p>

<p>But the monument, which had survived the
accidents of Time for so long, was fated to survive
the storm. Instead of plunging to the bottom of
the Bay of Biscay, it tossed about on the heaving
waters for nearly three days. Then it was sighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
by a steamer, and taken in tow, to be brought at
last to England.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that this same monolith, which
a Pharaoh erected on the banks of the Nile to tell
the sun-worshippers of his glorious deeds in war,
should now be reposing on the banks of the river
Thames, and that it has survived the age of bows and
arrows to be damaged by bombs from aeroplanes.
What a story Cleopatra’s Needle would tell if it
could only speak.</p>

<p>Kings were more than kings to the common
people of Egypt. They were looked upon as gods,
the possessors of divine power. They were called
the sons of Ra, and Ra often figures in their
titles. From being called the son of Ra, the
ruler in the eyes of the people acquired the
mythical power of the god himself, and was worshipped
by his subjects, who shielded their faces
from the glory which the monarch spread around
him.</p>

<p>The Egyptians have worshipped many gods in
many ages. Gods have risen, grown powerful,
and been superseded, but always the kings have
shared the powers of the various gods, and the
people looked upon the king as the living image of
the god they worshipped.</p>

<p>Their religions, after the lapse of ages, seem very
strange to peoples in other lands. Yet they had
much to commend them, and many of the teachings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
of the Christian religion were anticipated in the
religions of the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>We look upon the Nile dwellers as pagans, but
we cannot deny the logic of the religion which
taught them to worship the sun and the Nile, on
which they depended for light and life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Gradually</span> the romance of ancient Egypt
is being revealed by the graves of those
who died in remote times, yet to read the
romance at first hand requires exceptional ability
that is possessed by only a few men. Little bits
of evidence of no importance to the casual onlooker
are fraught with immense importance to the
scientific seeker.</p>

<p>The most wonderful tombs in the world are to be
found in Egypt in the shape of the Pyramids, and
as the centuries recede the tombs gradually become
simpler until they arrive back at the simplest of all—just
a shallow hole scooped out of the ground,
in which the dead man rests on a skin.</p>

<p>Consequently the graves of Egypt reveal the rise
of Egypt’s civilizations; they indicate how man’s
ideas have changed, how primitive customs have
slowly passed away and given rise to the most
remarkable practices connected with the dead of
which we have any trace. The later stone tombs
needed no seeking; they were plain to every
traveller who journeyed up the Nile. Earlier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
tombs built of brick were found, revealing a more
ancient state of civilization, when men were
ignorant of the ways of working stone, or found it
too difficult to devote their energies to shaping
stone to be built into a tomb. Going back and
back, the brick tombs get smaller and smaller,
until they disappear, and only the grave remains
in which the dead lie doubled up. These were the
things that years of work taught, but the earliest
graves of all long eluded the eyes of modern workers.</p>

<p>One day Professor Flinders Petrie came across
remains. The greatest care was exercised in
digging, so that every shred of evidence could be
collected, and as the sand and soil were drawn
aside he saw it was a very ancient grave, older than
anything ever dreamed of in connection with Egypt.
No one had any idea that Egypt was inhabited so
long ago, but here was proof that men lived in the
Nile valley in the dark ages of Time.</p>

<p>The evidence goes to show that a crude civilization
existed there ten thousand years ago, and that
men may have lived in the Nile valley over twenty
thousand years ago. Whether any relics will ever
be found to throw any light on this epoch of
Egyptian history remains to be seen, but it would
not be astonishing if something did eventually
appear, for the country has powers of preservation
which even to-day are only faintly recognized, and
the earth can hide things so cunningly that human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
beings may search for centuries and never find them
again. The fact that they are not found is no
proof that they never existed.</p>

<p>When this ancient man hunted on the banks of
the Nile, he gazed upon a very different land from
that which exists to-day. The river was wider
and shallower. It overflowed its banks for greater
distances. The banks of gravel which show where
the waters of the river lapped in bygone centuries
still exist, but they are far removed from the river,
and a hundred feet or so higher.</p>

<p>In all the thousands of years that have elapsed
since then, the Nile has been cutting a deeper and
deeper channel for itself. In all the years that it
has been bringing down the mud in solution,
flowing over the land, some of the mud has sunk
to the bottom and remained; much of it has been
carried from the Delta to the sea. The mud
that sank has got deeper and deeper. The river
has added to the deposit inch by inch, until there
is now a wonderful layer of alluvial soil: just the
mud of the Nile, between 30 and 40 feet thick on
each side of the stream.</p>

<p>This deposit itself has helped to give scientists
an idea of the age of the earliest human remains
that have been found. The rate at which the river
leaves the mud behind has been carefully measured,
and men have learned that in a century the Nile
will add 4 inches of soil to the fields by flooding.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
Test holes have revealed the present depth of the
alluvial, and if roughly about a yard of deposition
is allowed for one thousand years, and about 10
or 12 yards are allowed for the depth, then the age
of the deposit is fixed at ten or twelve thousand
years.</p>

<p>In some quarters this time is considered as
absolutely accurate and definitely fixed, but there
are so many factors to be taken into account that
we should hesitate to regard them as unalterable.
The Nile, it is true, has been depositing mud at the
rate of 4 inches to the century in modern times,
but this is no proof that it has always deposited
mud at this rate, and there may have been considerable
changes in the rate at which the mud
banks have grown on each side of the stream.
We know the floods vary considerably, and the
rate of deposition must vary similarly. There
seems at least the possibility that it took twice as
long as the accepted estimate to deposit the mud
on each side of the river, that is twenty thousand
years. For aught we know, it may have taken
two hundred thousand years.</p>

<p>It will be seen how difficult it is in dealing with
the lapse of such ages to mention any definite
dates. This is why the men who are digging up
the past in Egypt refer to Dynasties, starting with
the First Dynasty, and working up to the last or
Thirtieth Dynasty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>A great deal has been done towards discovering
the names of the various kings in the different
Dynasties, but there are still many gaps to fill in.
Most of our information in this respect has been
given us by a list of names compiled by a priest
named Manetho, who lived about two thousand
one hundred years ago. Manetho undoubtedly
based his names of kings on more ancient lists
which have totally disappeared, but that he was
fairly accurate is borne out by the Turin papyrus
so far as it has been translated. The difficulty
with this papyrus is that it was discovered in a
number of fragments, and some parts of it are
missing. However, the parts that remain have
been most carefully pieced together, and seem to
verify Manetho’s list, which starts with Menes,
who is looked upon as the first king of the First
Dynasty, and is thought to have reigned about
seven thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Throughout the ages that followed the reign of
Menes, there grew up those religious beliefs and
quaint burial customs which have done so much
to unfold to us the life of the past. At first sight
there seems to be no reason for all the statues, the
tiny figures, and wonderful wall inscriptions to be
found in the ancient tombs of Egypt. It seems
incomprehensible that the dead should be buried
with food and flowers beside them, that all this
artistic talent should be wasted in this manner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Yet some such customs exist in all lands, and
survive to this day, for we still place wreaths of
flowers on the graves of our departed in memory
of them, but actually the giving of a wreath is
based on a custom that recedes so far back that
all trace of it has been lost.</p>

<p>The Egyptians believed that there was another
world, to which the soul journeyed after death.
But the journey was long and hazardous, and the
soul faced many perils on the way. In order to
protect the soul from danger, the Egyptians used
to paint an image of the Sun God within the tomb,
thus placing the soul directly under the protection
of the god, and the soul would wander over the
heavens in the company of the god, immune from
all harm, so long as the daylight lasted.</p>

<p>Directly darkness fell, all the evil spirits would
come forth from their retreats, and try to trap
the soul as it stumbled blindly through the labyrinths
of the lower regions. All night the soul
would fight against these perils, struggling continually
towards the dawn. Then, as the sun came
up, the soul would escape from the evil demons,
and wander free of danger through the heavens
once more until darkness fell.</p>

<p>Every human being was also considered to possess
a perfect duplicate, a double, and the Egyptians
were taught that the life of this double depended
on the survival of the body, and if the double had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
no body to return to, the double would become
extinct and die for good. Such a thing was too
terrible to contemplate, and had it happened it
would have signified eternal disgrace to the living,
as well as obliteration to the dead. Consequently
the body was embalmed, so that it would be preserved
for all time as a place of refuge for the double.</p>

<p>There was the risk, however, that despite all
precautions, something might happen to the
embalmed body, that it might be destroyed by
some accident quite unforeseen and unforeseeable.
The Egyptians must have considered this danger
long and earnestly before they arrived at a method
of averting it.</p>

<p>The method was simplicity itself. What could
serve the purpose better than a statue of the
deceased? If the mummy became damaged, there
was always the likeness in stone for the double to
inhabit. Then somebody decided that two statues
would provide two chances for the double to survive
in case of accident to the mummy, and once the
idea was fully established the number of statues
multiplied until there was a dozen or more, all
the same, carved in stone, to represent the dead
man. To avoid the possibility of the double
making any mistake, the likeness of the dead man
was portrayed. This accounts for the finding of
so many statues of kings; each statue gave the
king a chance in the afterlife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>To provide sustenance for the double before it
reached the Egyptian equivalent of Paradise, jars
of water, meat and bread were buried with the
mummy. It would not do for the dead to go
hungry. Theoretically the foodstuffs should have
been replenished from time to time, and no doubt
for long this was done, but the Egyptians finally
found that it was difficult enough to provide for the
living, without toiling to feed the dead.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the offerings to the dead
became somewhat of a drain on the resources of
these ancient Nile dwellers, so again they solved
the problem in quite a simple way. If they painted
all the offerings on the walls of the tombs, and
prayed to the gods to provide the departed with
the things needed in the afterworld, such painted
offerings would last for ever, and relieve the living
of the demands on their foodstuffs. Consequently,
all over the tombs, these pictures of offerings may be
found, to serve the deceased if he should need food
during his wanderings to the Egyptian Paradise.</p>

<p>The little images known as Ushabti were placed
in the tomb, in case the deceased were called upon
to work in the next world. They were his servants,
who would labour for him and save their master
from performing menial tasks. The boats or barges
that are found were to ferry the dead man over
the sacred waters to the Fields of the Blessed.</p>

<p>The Egyptians, indeed, considered that everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
required in this life would be needed in the
next. It is well for us that they had these ideas,
for they have resulted in many remarkable relics
being found in the tombs, relics which help the
scientists to reconstruct the life of these wonderful
ancients, to revive the romance of their lost
civilization.</p>

<p>In order that the dead man might not lose his
identity, his name was graven within the tomb,
and in time the outstanding features of his life were
also mentioned, so that the gods should be conversant
with all he had done. Some of these notes
are short, others long, but all of them are of importance
as showing us what happened while the dead
man was alive. We have our own National
Biography printed on paper, and carefully bound
to place on our shelves, but the National Biography
of Ancient Egypt is carved upon mountains of
stones in the tombs of the land. They are the
books of the distant past, but there is the possibility
that they will survive when many of our
modern books have perished utterly from the
earth.</p>

<br>

<p>The commonest of all the ancient manuscripts
that have survived to our day is the well-known
Book of the Dead. It is another relic which serves
to indicate the thought devoted by the Egyptians
to life in the next world. The Book of the Dead is
a sacred book, which tells the dead man what to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>say to the gods when he meets them, how to answer
their questions. Osiris is the Judge who weighs
the man’s heart, and considers if he be worthy to
enter the Realms of Bliss. And the departed is
instructed what to say. “I have not played the
hypocrite,” he avers. “I have not stolen,” is
another answer he must make. “I have not lied.
I have not committed adultery. I am no slayer of
men.”</p>

<p>There are forty-two of these Confessions in the
Book of the Dead, and it is astounding how they
resemble the Ten Commandments upon which are
based the Christian religion. In the replies just
quoted may be traced three commandments:
“Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit
adultery. Thou shalt do no murder.”</p>

<p>Who can say after this whence the wisdom of
the Bible sprang? The religion of the ancient
Egyptians seems false to our eyes, but underlying
it are many fine principles, and much of the truth
that is eternal.</p>

<p>Even in those remote times, however, there were
people who were ever ready to take advantage of
the grief of the relatives of the departed. A Book
of the Dead was essential to the well-being of the
departed, once he came into the presence of the
gods, and the living would go to the scribe and
acquire the finest copy of the Book that lay within
their means. The wonderfully painted Books were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
only for the wealthy and the nobles. The poor
people had to be satisfied with something that
was much inferior, from which a great deal of the
text was missing.</p>

<p>The poorer classes were, of course, unable to read
the sacred script, and would therefore be unaware
that much of the text was missing; that the Book
was, in fact, so much abridged, that they were
acquiring a garbled version, bearing little resemblance
to the full Book. They would have the body
embalmed, and see the sacred Book placed within
reach of the mummy’s hand, so that it could be
consulted directly it was required, little knowing
that the Book upon which they relied was but an
imitation of the genuine sacred Book.</p>

<p>In fact, in those days, it was more or less the
same as it is to-day. The scribe scamped the work
of the Book that he was poorly paid for, and took
more pains with the Book for which he received a
better price.</p>

<p>Discoveries seem to indicate that although the
people had faith in the Book of the Dead, the
scribes themselves were inclined to be unbelievers.
It is fairly evident that they had no compunction
in defrauding the relatives, for when the scribe had
sold a beautiful copy to place with one of the
departed, he would very often slip in a blank
papyrus along with the mummy, and abstract the
fine Book, knowing full well that his fraud would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
never be found out. Probably he reasoned that it
was rather a waste to place such a fine specimen of
his work where it would be lost for ever. It is
quite likely that some of the scribes devoted a vast
amount of time and skill to making a wonderful
copy of the Book of the Dead that they could show
to relatives to get their order, with the intention of
substituting an inferior work, or even a blank.
Thus their one fine copy would be a source of
income to them, and they would never part with it
if they could possibly avoid it.</p>

<p>Judging from the blanks and poor copies that
have been recovered, there is little doubt that the
Egyptians of old were quite as guilty of sharp
practices as are some of the people of to-day.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Since</span> the dawn of history the Pyramids
have been considered one of the wonders
of the earth. They are unique. There is
nothing to compare with them in any other land.
Strangers have gazed upon them in amazement,
and pondered what they were and how and why
they were built.</p>

<p>Myths that they were the work of the gods became
numerous, for the structures were so gigantic that
it seemed impossible that puny man could have built
them. About their human origin there was no
doubt to discerning travellers, but the object in
building them was not always so plain.</p>

<p>Long and learned books have been written to
show that the Pyramids bore some special astronomical
significance; that one of the main passages
in the Great Pyramid was built at a certain angle
to enable the astronomers of earlier days to watch a
certain star pass in its course across the opening in
the face of the Pyramid; that the height of the
Great Pyramid bore a definite relation to the distance
of the earth from the sun; that the base of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
Pyramid meant something else. In fact, the
Pyramid has been measured in all directions, in all
sorts of manners, and these measurements have
been made to fit in with pet theories which have
been the basis of many books.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest mystery as to what
the Pyramids actually are. They are merely
tombs. But people have not been content to accept
this explanation, perhaps because it is too simple,
so they have endowed the Pyramids with all sorts
of wonderful meanings which would astound the
builders were they to come back from the Fields
of the Blessed. Astrologers who puzzled on the
meanings of the stars in the heavens claimed the
Great Pyramid as peculiarly their own, and pointed
out certain coincidences in measurements to support
their claim; the astronomers adduced their own
reasons for claiming that the Pyramid had some
astronomical meaning; Biblical students, on the
other hand, who sought the hidden meanings of the
Bible, concluded that the Pyramid was definite
proof of certain of their own theories.</p>

<p>The Pyramids have indeed been so enwrapped
in mystery, by the writings and theories of successive
generations, that thousands of people to-day regard
them with a sort of religious belief.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been written on the
subject, and the undoubted cleverness with which
these theories have been propounded, the Pyramids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
are only tombs. But they are the most wonderful
tombs in the world. They are simple and grand,
with the desert sands surging round their bases,
while a short distance away the Nile flows along
to the blue sea. There is one other tomb without
peer, the Taj Mahal, in India, that beautiful dream
in marble which Shah Jehan erected in Delhi to
the memory of the lady he loved so well. But the
Taj is very different—graceful, glorious. Yet the
Pyramids, in their simple grandeur, are not without
a beauty of their own.</p>

<p>Kings have come and gone, civilizations have
bloomed and vanished, the very earth itself has
altered since the Pyramids were first built. Whirlwinds
have caught up the sands of the desert and
used them as a giant sandblast in their attempts to
wear away the stone, earthquakes have shattered
temples, but on the monuments the forces of Nature
have had little effect. The hand of man has wrought
more destruction in a few centuries than Nature
herself wrought in two or three thousands of years.
What man built, man has partly destroyed; yet
man, with all his ingenuity for destruction, has done
little but touch the outer surface of the Great
Pyramid.</p>

LAPPED BY THE ETERNAL SANDS OF THE DESERT</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>There are nearly eighty Pyramids of different
sizes scattered throughout the Nile valley. The
greatest and most renowned is that of King Khufu
or Cheops, at Gizeh, which originally measured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>355 feet 8 inches at the base, and 481 feet 4 inches
in height. The base of the Great Pyramid covers
well over 12 acres, and an idea of the size of the
monument may be gained when it is known that
to walk round it means trudging through the sands
for more than half a mile.</p>

<p>Over nineteen centuries ago, Julius Cæsar sent
from Egypt one of the most famous letters ever
written. It was short, but three words: “Veni,
Vedi, Veci.” These three words carried a wealth
of meaning. They told of a safe journey, of an
emperor gazing on the land he was going to conquer,
of a successful invasion. “I came, I saw, I conquered,”
wrote Cæsar, who in turn was conquered
by the beauty of Cleopatra.</p>

<p>Who can say what were the thoughts of the
Roman emperor as he stood within the shadow of
the age-old Pyramids? He was a powerful potentate,
but the same thoughts must have flitted
through his mind as have surged through the brains
of countless unknown men when they first caught
sight of the Wonders of the Desert. He must
have meditated on their origin, and how they
were built.</p>

<p>In modern times Napoleon, the greatest soldier
the world has ever seen, paced in the shadow of
these same Pyramids, and reflected on the eternal
questions regarding them. Lord Kitchener, before
he attained to fame, gazed on them hundreds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
times. The great ones go to their eternal rest, but
the Pyramids remain.</p>

<p>They were built to endure for all time. The
Egyptians looked upon the tomb as their permanent
home, which was to last for all eternity. This is
the reason for the erection of these mountains of
stone, for their solidity of construction, for their
gigantic size. They have grown out of Egypt’s
religious beliefs. They were built solid and big
and strong, so that nothing should overturn them,
so that they should defy the hand of Time and Man,
and forever provide a resting-place, a home for the
shadow-self of the King.</p>

<p>Directly a Pharaoh came to the throne, he began
preparing for his last long sleep. His lifework
was to prepare a tomb for himself befitting his
rank and power, and he spared no pains nor means
to accomplish his desire. He called his chief architects
and his high priests around him, and demanded
that plans be made and a site selected. Then he
saw the foundation stone laid, and year by year
watched the pile of masonry grow.</p>

<p>Judging by the number of Pyramids in existence
and their size, it has been reckoned that the total
man-power of Egypt was devoted for over a thousand
years to building tombs for the rulers, that
tomb-building, in fact, was the main industry of
the country for centuries.</p>

<p>To build another pyramid the size of the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops would be a brilliant
engineering feat even in our time, with all the
engineering means we have at our disposal. The
more we consider the Great Pyramid, the more
amazing it seems that the Egyptians should have
succeeded in erecting such an enormous monument
some six thousand years ago. To this day
it is not fully understood how it was done, but
gradually evidence is accumulating which serves
to indicate the principal methods that were
adopted.</p>

<p>A few miles away, on the other side of the Nile,
the limestone was quarried from the hillside at
Turah. Thousands of men laboured at cutting
out the mighty blocks. These were probably
squared up roughly in the quarries, and then either
transported to the barges on rollers made from the
trunks of palm trees, or else mounted on wooden
sledges that were dragged over the ground by the
united efforts of hundreds of slaves. Great skill
must have been required to get them safely aboard,
and to unload them from the barges when they
arrived on the other side of the river. There is
little doubt that the site of the Pyramid was chosen
close to the river and to the Turah quarries to make
transport as simple as possible.</p>

<p>The Pyramid is built in a series of steps, the
lower courses of blocks being 4 feet 11 inches high,
the size diminishing as the Pyramid gets higher.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Before a stone was cut or laid the Pyramid must
have been carefully planned on papyri; for aught
we know models may have been built to ensure its
accuracy. It is plain that the builder must have
calculated the sizes of all the stones course by
course and the number required, for their regularity
in size is not only amazing, but is also proof that
the building of the Pyramid was most carefully
worked out.</p>

<p>So extraordinary was the degree of accuracy
attained by the ancient architects, that it is doubtful
if a single building in all London is so correctly
and accurately built as was the Great Pyramid
sixty centuries ago. The Egyptians were clever
enough to fix their site so that the sides of the
Pyramid faced exactly north, south, east and west,
without any deviation whatsoever. They had
some means of measuring whereby they were able
to build the lengths of the sides so truly, that
there was not half an inch of difference in any
one of them. The builder who is able to build
four such walls over 750 feet long, without varying
them half an inch in all that length, is a king of
his profession. Probably there is not a house put
up to-day that does not vary considerably more
in the length of its small walls. For sheer accuracy
in its measurements, the Great Pyramid is one
of the most marvellous structures on earth, and
the Egyptians were apparently able to do six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
thousand years ago what we find it difficult to
accomplish to-day.</p>

<p>The Great Wall of China was built at the sacrifice
of hundreds of thousands of lives, and probably
thousands of men perished in the building of the
Pyramids. Accidents must have been happening all
day long. The huge blocks were handled by men who
dragged and pushed them to their positions. The
labourers were kept hard at it by their taskmasters,
whose one thought was to keep up the supply
of stone. Mighty blocks weighing many tons
must have often slipped and crushed the workers
to death. Many of the labourers must have been
maimed for life; legs were broken, arms smashed,
heads and bodies crushed, as the blocks rolled and
swerved in their progress.</p>

<p>From inferences from papyri, the great Pyramids
were looked upon by the Egyptians as one of their
plagues, as a scourge to the land. Men were pressed
into the work, were compelled to go on with it.
What mattered it to Khufu if his subjects and
slaves died, so long as he built a home that would
last his shadow-self for ever? We are wont to
marvel at the building of the Pyramids, but under
it all there must have been great cruelty as well
as an incredible skill. Those monuments which
to-day are the glory of Egypt, were in the past
one of the afflictions of the land.</p>

<p>The building of the Great Pyramid entailed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
creation of a mighty sloping road, which Herodotus
says took 100,000 men ten years to construct.
Men swarmed over the desert like ants over a
disturbed anthill, making this enormous slope
up which to drag and push these gigantic blocks.
The centre of the slope was paved with polished
stone, so that the blocks would slide easily along,
but in spite of this attempt to ease the burden,
the moving of the stones must have been a heart-breaking
task. As the Pyramid rose, so the road
grew higher.</p>

<p>The blocks would be heaved out of the barges
by dozens of men. Great wooden levers would
be inserted under the stones to prise them up to
allow the rollers to be slipped under; then hundreds
of men would take hold of the long ropes, harnessing
themselves like beasts of burden, and drag the
stones along. Men with levers would help by
thrusting behind; others would walk at the sides
to attend to the rollers, and run to the front with
new ones directly the last had passed underneath
the stone at the back. We can imagine ropes
breaking, and mighty stones plunging down the
causeway, sweeping scores of poor victims to
destruction. Blood and tears as well as labour
went to the building of the Pyramids.</p>

<p>From first to last, so far as we are able to gather,
about 100,000 men slaved for thirty years to build
the tomb of Khufu. The site chosen was not exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
level. A little hillock of rock rose on one part of it,
and this was cleverly squared off and incorporated
into the Pyramid, saving the transport of so many
hundreds of tons of rock.</p>

<p>The great aim of Khufu, or Cheops, as that of all
the other Pharaohs, was to protect his mummy,
and prevent thieves getting into his burial chamber.
To this end were devised numerous secret passages,
all of which show an extraordinary ingenuity in
planning, and great engineering skill in execution.
The entrance to the Great Pyramid is about 45 feet
up on the north face. One of the blocks of stone
was made to swing inward on a pivot, and when
closed it was quite impossible to locate the entrance.
The Pyramid looked quite solid, without a single
breach in any one of its sides. So cleverly was the
entrance contrived that it baffled men for thousands
of years, although countless thieves went over the
Pyramid seeking eagerly for a way in. Only a
lucky accident could have led the discoverer to
touch that particular stone in the right way to make
it swing back and disclose the opening.</p>

<p>Even when he found the opening, he was not
much nearer the burial chamber. An underground
passage was driven for over 350 feet through the
solid rock at an angle below the foundations of the
Pyramid, until it opened out in a chamber immediately
beneath the point of the Pyramid. The
chamber is really a fine hall about 46 feet long by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
27 feet wide, with a roof 11½ feet above the level
of the floor. On the other side of the chamber the
underground passage continues for over 50 feet, but
we are quite at a loss to divine the reason for this
extension. Maybe the engineers drove this gallery
with the definite intention of misleading any one
who should eventually break a way into this underground
retreat. At any rate, it is, like the rest
of the passage, driven through the solid rock, and
finishes up against the rock wall. No other outlet
from this passage has ever been discovered, so its
object is a mystery. Perhaps the engineers’ plans
were altered, or perhaps it was designed to baffle
thieves, and compel them to waste time by searching
for an opening where none exists.</p>

<p>Khufu did not underrate the skill of the plunderers
of the tombs. He realized to the full their patience
and cleverness, and did all in his power to outwit
them. The passage is lined throughout with blocks
of stone, and we can imagine the robbers searching
anxiously up and down the dark passage, casting
back and fore, tapping the stones to try to find the
outlet leading to the King’s Chamber. All the
blocks look exactly alike, and they may have
sought for months before they found that block in
the roof which pivoted in a similar manner to the
stone covering the entrance. This passage branched
upward to the Queen’s Chamber, and opened out
to the Grand Gallery, which is very narrow and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
high, at the end of which comes another passage
leading to the Chamber of King Khufu.</p>

<p>Before the robbers were able to reach these
chambers, they had many difficulties to surmount
and problems to solve. At various intervals the
passage was sealed by four mighty blocks of very
hard granite. These blocks must have been supported
until after the funeral ceremonies were
completed; then the priests withdrew, the supports
were knocked away, and the blocks crashed down
into position in the deep grooves that were cut for
them in the passage.</p>

<p>When the intruders surmounted one block, they
were confronted by another. Their labours on the
second brought them to a full stop against the face
of the third. No one knows how long it took for
the thieves to break into the Pyramid, but it must
have taken years from the time the first secret
opening was discovered. So hard was the granite
with which the passage leading to the King’s and
Queen’s Chambers was closed, that in one case the
thieves despaired of ever getting through it, so they
laboriously cut a way through the roof of the
passage and clambered over the top of the granite
block. They must have reaped a very rich booty,
of which every trace has long since vanished.</p>

<p>All that remains to-day is the red granite sarcophagus
in the King’s Chamber. It is an enormous
stone coffin, so big that its removal is an impossibility.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
It is too big to be taken through the passages.
The size of it indicates that it must have been placed
in position when the Pyramid was being built. It
shows how carefully everything was planned.</p>

<p>The King’s Chamber is 34 feet 3 inches long, by
17 feet 1 inch wide, with a height of 19 feet 1 inch.
It is one of the wonders of the Pyramid, lined with
enormous slabs of highly polished granite which
reach from floor to ceiling, slabs 19 feet 1 inch
high. The ceiling itself is composed of the same
granite, in giant slabs nearly 4 feet wide and 17 feet
1 inch long. There are nine of these mighty slabs
of polished stone, reaching from wall to wall. Their
weight must be enormous, and the difficulty of
getting them into position must have been prodigious.
So skilfully and accurately fitted were
many of the stones in the passages, that even now
the point of a needle cannot be inserted between
the slabs where they join.</p>

<p>It seems incomprehensible at first sight why this
King’s Chamber has not been crushed out of existence
thousands of years ago by the weight of the
masonry over it. It must be remembered that
what amounts to a mountain of stone rears its
peak 200 feet or more above. Investigation reveals
that the builders were fully alive to this danger,
and the steps they took to avoid it were not only
very clever, but they have worked perfectly for
thousands of years. Earthquakes have occurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
from time to time and displaced some of the stones,
but the King’s Chamber is still intact and uncrushed.</p>

<p>The methods adopted by these clever old builders
to preserve the Chamber are very simple, yet anything
more brilliantly successful it would be difficult
to devise. Above the King’s Chamber four other
chambers were built to take the weight off the roof,
and over these chambers two mighty slabs of hard
stone were placed astride, leaning together at the
top edges, which were so accurately cut that they
could not possibly become displaced. These two
stones, with their tops resting against each other,
just as children lean two cards together on a table,
take the weight of all the masonry above them, and
deflect the thrust of the weight outwards instead of
downwards, so that the King’s Chamber is amply
protected.</p>

<p>The Pyramid of Khafra or Chephren, slightly
smaller than the Great Pyramid, is still a mighty
monument of the past, and although the Egyptians
were free from foreign wars when it was built, they
groaned under the necessity of doing this work for
the king at home. The building of the Pyramids
was one of the hardships of the Egyptian nation.</p>

<p>When the Great Pyramid was finished, a pinnacle
of hard limestone was set on the top, and all the
steps were filled in from the peak downwards with
the same stone, to make the surface of the Pyramid
quite smooth from apex to foundation. But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
facing blocks of stone have now all disappeared.
Many of them have been carried off to put into new
buildings, others lie shattered all about the base,
where the debris rises for 40 feet or so. The point
of the Great Pyramid has also gone, and there is
now a platform about 36 feet square, on which
visitors may stand and gaze on the wonders of
the desert.</p>

<p>Only 500 yards away the head of the Great
Sphinx emerges from the sands. Nobody knows
what the Sphinx represents. The most learned
investigators are uncertain of its origin and age.
Some think it may have been carved by the sculptors
of one of the great pyramid builders, but others
regard it as very much older. Probably it represents
the sun god Ra, but for centuries the Arabs
have known it as the Father of Terrors.</p>

<p>From the tip of its paws to the end of its back it
measures 190 feet. It is 65 feet high, and its neck
is 69 feet round, while the tallest man could roll
in between the lips, were they open, for they are
7 feet wide. The Sphinx is still joined to the mother
rock which forms the floor of the desert hereabouts.
It was carved out of the outcropping stone, which
the sculptors chipped and fashioned with infinite
labour into the shape of the Father of Terrors.
The astounding thing is that in spite of the gigantic
size of the figure, the proportions are faultless.</p>

<p>Between its paws was a temple, that gave up a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>statue of Khafra, the builder of the Second Pyramid,
but temple and paws are now covered with sand.
Indeed the Sphinx has spent the greater part of its
existence under the sands of the desert. One of the
first things Thothmes IV did when he came to the
throne over three thousand years ago, was to set
men to uncover the Sphinx, and dig the sand away
from its 140-foot-long body. From time to time
others have removed the sand, but always the
sand comes back and quickly steals over the body
and covers it, leaving the head emerging like some
monster of the desert.</p>

<p>In the past the Sphinx has been badly treated
by the ignorant Arabs, who have smashed its face
about and given it that strange expression which is
a half-wry smile. Probably thousands of years
hence, when our present civilization has disappeared
and been forgotten, the Sphinx will still be regarding
the Nile and the world with the same half-sad,
half-mocking expression.</p>

<p>The Sphinx is as lasting as the mountains, as
eternal as the rock out of which it is carved. The
riddle of the origin of this masterpiece of an ancient
civilization may yet be solved by a man digging
with a spade in the desert sands.</p>

<p>The famous Colossi of Memnon, set up by
Amenhotep <span class="allsmcap">III</span> in front of his chapel on the bank
of the Nile at Thebes, almost rival the Sphinx in
their gigantic stature. The great figures, 50 feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
high, are carved out of solid blocks of limestone,
and there they sit on guard as they have sat for
thousands of years. The floods of the Nile swirl
about them, laving their injured feet, but the
temple they guarded has long since vanished from
the face of the earth.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Thebes</span> at its zenith was one of the glories
of the old world, with some of the most
marvellous temples ever imagined by the
mind of man or executed by human hand. The
ancient capital of Egypt was unequalled in magnificence.
King after king increased the wonders of
the temple of Ammon; their sculptors carved great
sphinxes out of stone, which were set up in an
avenue over a mile long. Building after building
was added to the original one. Mighty gateways,
or pylons, 142 feet high, were built, and from these
projected flagstaffs on which gaily coloured banners
fluttered in the breeze.</p>

<p>The great hall of Ammon was composed of pillars
78 feet high and 33 feet round, all carved and painted
in vivid colours. Lesser halls and temples were
added, and here, amid a blaze of colour and sunshine,
the festivals were held, the high priests performed
their sacred rites, the Pharaoh drove up in
his gorgeous chariots with the harness of his horses
ablaze with gold, while his subjects shielded their
faces from the monarch who shared the glory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
Ammon. At intervals the high priests brought out
the sacred boat of the god, raised it aloft on their
shoulders, and carried it around the temple, while
the populace stood silent with awe. For a brief
instant the curtains were drawn aside, and the god
was disclosed to the multitude before returning
to the silence and sanctity of the temple, from which
the common people were rigidly excluded.</p>

<p>About the king gathered all the wit and wisdom
of the Egyptian empire. Magnificent banquets
were held, at which were served to the guests fine
dishes of venison, roast ducks and other fowl, and
fish. Wine flowed, maidens danced. There was
talk and laughter and love.</p>

<p>To-day Thebes has vanished. The one-time
capital of Egypt is a desert ruin. Near by are
the villages of Karnak and Luxor, with a few natives
living in their humble dwellings, and just a big
hotel for the use of travellers, who come here to gaze
on the ruins of the past.</p>

<p>It is strange that thousands of years ago, when
these islands were inhabited by a few savages who
painted their bodies, threw a skin about them for
warmth, and lived in the rudest of huts for shelter,
far away to the south on the Nile a mighty civilization
was flourishing, that would compare very
favourably with the civilization of to-day.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>While the barbarians of Britain were building
their rude huts, the Egyptians were carving colossal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>pillars for the Hall of the Temple of Ammon, pillars
over 30 feet round, and painting them with colours
which are still fresh after all this lapse of time.
Even then they had been building with brick for
thousands of years. The tomb paintings show the
brickmakers puddling the alluvial soil with their
feet, shaping the mud into bricks, and baking
them hard in the fierce heat of the sun. Moreover
these bricks endured for centuries, and still
endure; whereas many of the red bricks made
in England thirty or forty years ago are perishing
fast.</p>

<p>Speculation is still going on as to how the
Egyptians used to handle the enormous stones
found in the ruins, and how they managed to place
in position monuments like Cleopatra’s Needle.
There is mention of certain engines having been
used to lift the stones of the Pyramids, but what
these engines were, nobody to-day can say with
certainty.</p>

<p>Cleopatra’s Needle was roughly shaped on three
sides in the quarry, before it was detached from
the mother rock. The methods of detaching a
monument from the rock show that the Egyptians
were quite conversant with natural laws, that they
possessed the ability to harness these laws in order
to save human labour. How many modern craftsmen
would succeed in separating one of these huge
stones from the mountain-side, by using such simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
things as a drill, some wooden pegs, and water?
With these crude implements the task would be
looked upon nowadays as impossible. Yet from
obelisks still attached to the rock, it is obvious
that such primitive appliances were sufficient to
enable the Egyptians to perform their ancient
miracles.</p>

<p>On the exact line where they desired to sever the
stone, they cut a deep groove, and at frequent
intervals along this groove they drilled holes, into
which they hammered wooden pegs very tightly,
until the tops were a little below the surface of the
stone. Then water was poured on the pegs, and as
it soaked into the wood they swelled, until the
expansion of them all together was so irresistible
that the rock was split along the groove.</p>

<p>Many huge pillars and statues were also sculptured
in the living rock before being detached, for areas
of rock have been found all marked off in squares
with figures drawn on them ready to be carved by
the sculptor. Like the stones of the Pyramids,
many of these figures and monoliths were transported
on sleds, others were dragged over rollers.
It was a common practice to send thousands of
men to some distant place, to cut out a giant block
of stone, and bring it back for the use of the king.
Ancient drawings showing gigantic statues being
dragged along on sledges by armies of slaves, reveal
to us how the transport was effected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>But there was the difficulty of erecting an obelisk
when it had reached the spot for which it was intended.
A weight of 186 tons, like that of Cleopatra’s
Needle, is a tremendous problem to handle,
yet the Egyptian engineers accomplished it successfully.
Such a weight was actually small compared
with some of the weights they tackled, for they
moved and erected single stones weighing twice and
thrice as much, that is weights up to nearly 600
tons.</p>

<p>If our engineers to-day were given the same
problem, they would still have to puzzle over it,
in spite of the giant cranes that could be brought
to the spot to help them. The mammoth lifting
machines designed by modern engineers were unknown
in the days of the Pharaohs, yet the ancients
were able to do work without them which we would
find it rather difficult to do with them.</p>

<p>Ever so many theories have been propounded as
to how they set up these huge blocks of stone. One
suggestion is that the stones were dragged to the
site and their bases placed in position; then in
some way, perhaps by the use of giant beams over
which the ropes attached to the top ends of the
stones were passed, they were pulled upright, a
little at a time. As they were hauled up, blocks
of stone may have been slipped under them to carry
the weight.</p>

<p>Other theories abound, but the likeliest theory of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
all is that the Egyptians built a big sloping embankment
like that used in the construction of the
Pyramids. Up this the obelisk was hauled, base
first, until it reached the very top, and projected
on to a bed of sand. Labourers shovelled the sand
away from under the obelisk, just as ants dig the
earth from beneath a mouse they want to bury,
and as the sand was removed, so the base of the
obelisk sank down, until it gradually tilted upright
exactly in the position designed for it. No simpler,
or more brilliant, way could be found of solving
this difficult problem.</p>

<p>One of the monoliths erected by Queen Hatshepsut,
at Karnak, is 109 feet high, and she records
that at her bidding this mighty stone, weighing
hundreds of tons, was hewn out of the quarry, the
sides were properly shaped, and the stone conveyed
to the site, all within seven months. The Queen
gave her orders, and the people obeyed.</p>

<p>Such methods, if they were followed to-day, would
be so expensive as to be prohibitive. In those
days there were no unions, and no union rates of
wages. The overseer of the works could have all
the labour he needed. If he could not manage
with a thousand labourers, then he could have ten
thousand. The king was the lord and master of
his people, as well as of his slaves. The overseer
had only to say that he wanted more men, and the
king would give orders for the men to be procured.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>If they did not come willingly, they would be seized
and pressed into the service of the king. So long
as they were doing the king’s work they would
be fed, but wages in the present sense were
unknown.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">THE BEAUTIFUL TEMPLE KNOWN AS PHARAOH’S BED, CRADLED IN THE WATERS OF THE NILE, WHICH HAVE COVERED
THE ISLAND OF PHILÆ AND PARTLY SUBMERGED THE NOBLE RUINS SINCE THE BUILDING OF THE ASSOUAN DAM</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Those noble ruins on the island of Philæ higher
up the Nile above Assouan may no more be seen
in all their glory. They have been sacrificed to
the Nile god and to modern necessities. Realizing
that the building of the great dam at Assouan
would raise the level of the river and submerge
the island, the builders went to enormous trouble
to underpin the ruins and make them secure
against the flood. This work was carried out
with great difficulty, and in a masterly manner.
The completion of the Assouan dam saw the
waters of the Nile slowly creep over the ruined
temples, and there may now be seen peeping above
the surface of the water the tops of a few
columns which, owing to their peculiar resemblance
to a fourpost bed, are generally known as
Pharaoh’s Bed.</p>

<p>A wonderful work in a land of wonders is the
barrage of Assouan, but the benefits that would
accrue to the land by holding up and deflecting
the waters of the Nile were not unrealized by the
ancients. Thousands of years ago the problems
of controlling the Nile were studied as carefully
as they have been studied in our own time. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
Pharaoh, known as Amenhotep III, ordered his
engineers to work out a scheme for controlling the
inundation. He desired to store up some of the
Nile water when there was an excess, and draw
on these surplus supplies when the river was
low.</p>

<p>The work he undertook was in its way as wonderful
as that at Assouan, but when we consider that it
was started nearly four thousand years ago it
appears even more marvellous. Labourers swarmed
over the land, cutting channels in the rock, and
driving canals connected with the great expanse
of water near Fayoum known as Lake Moeris, a
natural reservoir which served to store the water
just as the barrage at Assouan stores the water
to-day. The Pharaoh had the foresight to tap
this huge supply of water to irrigate the surrounding
country, and the land, no longer at the mercy of
the Nile floods, prospered accordingly.</p>

<p>Amenhotep, like all the other Pharaohs, was
anxious to protect his treasure from thieves, and
he commanded his cleverest architects to design
a palace in which people who went inside without
permission might wander for ever without finding
their way out again. The whole of the interior
of the palace was composed of small rooms, in
number three thousand, leading by narrow passages
one into the other. The way in and out was a
strict secret, and those who broke in might wander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
round and in and out of the chambers until they
died of starvation. This palace was the famous
Labyrinth, a maze in stone to defeat thieves and
robbers. No trace of it now remains.</p>

<p>The kings of Egypt and the chief men were
obsessed with the idea that their tombs would be
plundered, and that the robbers would deprive their
doubles of all chance of future life. It must be
admitted that they had good cause for their
obsession. They knew that the same subjects who
had buried previous kings and lamented their
deaths, had seized the first opportunity of rifling
the tombs of their treasures, and the Pharaohs
were well aware that their own subjects would not
be above doing the same thing.</p>

<p>To rifle a tomb was one of the greatest crimes
that could be committed, but the thieves were
quite prepared to sacrifice their chances in the
next life for the prospect of gaining something
in this.</p>

<p>The tombs indicate that for thousands of years
a continual battle of wits was being fought between
the kings, who wished to preserve their tombs from
desecration, and the thieves who wished to plunder
them. The kings built temples for themselves,
and had a strong burial chamber placed at one
end. The thieves broke in easily and abstracted
the treasure. Then the kings made secret burial
chambers in their temples for the safeguarding of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
their mummies, but the thieves located them, and
robbed them just the same.</p>

<p>At last a queen hit on the idea of building a
fine temple for herself at Thebes, with a special
sanctuary for her mummy. But not for a moment
did she intend her mummy to rest within the
shade of the temple. She sent her priests and tried
servants into the desolate valley, to seek a secret
hiding-place for her mummy high up in the cliff.
They cut a chamber in the rock, and made the
tomb in that valley known to-day as the Valley
of the Tombs of the Kings.</p>

<p>Other kings came to the valley. They erected
temples, and their engineers cut into the heart of
the mountains, to make chambers in which to hide
their bodies. They built up the places as strongly
as they could. They devised obstructions to stop
any one from entering. They hid the entrances
to the tombs so carefully, that it was impossible
to tell whether the places had ever been disturbed.</p>

<p>All their labour, all their secrecy, was in vain.
Not a single tomb in all Egypt has yet been found
intact. Every tomb discovered has been rifled of
its treasure. Even the tomb of Tutankhamen is
no exception. The actual holes which the robbers
made to enter the tomb were discovered, and, judging
by the wealth of the furniture and other things
remaining, the haul of gold and silver must have
been enormous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>The high priests, horrified at the desecration of
the tombs, feared so much for the royal mummies
in their charge, that they went out stealthily into
the deserted hills and sought a secret hiding-place.
Then they brought many royal mummies to it,
one by one, probably under cover of darkness,
and hid them away from thievish eyes and
hands.</p>

<p>For centuries, for thousands of years, the robbers
were defeated; the ancient kings and queens of
Egypt slept on undisturbed in their secret sepulchre.
Yet in the end the tomb robbers triumphed. Somehow,
sometime, they managed to find the tomb.
They did not blazon their discovery to the world.
The booty was too rich for that, so they began
systematically robbing the tomb and disposing of
the relics to travellers who passed that way.</p>

<p>The ultimate discovery of the tomb by Sir
Gaston Maspero is one of the greatest romances
of Egyptology. One day in 1881, a visitor showed
Maspero some wonderfully illuminated pages of a
royal ritual. Maspero, gazing on them in amazement,
inquired whence they came, and learned that
they had been bought at Thebes.</p>

<p>Instantly all Maspero’s suspicions crystallized
into action. He had long suspected that the Arabs
had found a royal tomb, and here was definite
evidence. Without delay he journeyed to Thebes,
and discussed the matter with the authorities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
Secret inquiries pointed to four brothers, who lived
in some deserted tombs, as having knowledge of
the find. A decision to arrest one of them, in
the hopes that he would speak, was at once carried
into effect. The Arab was thrown into prison,
but he said nothing, denied all knowledge of the
matter for seven or eight weeks. Maspero could
not wait. Offering a big reward for information
of the discovery, he returned down the Nile, and
ultimately his reward tempted one of the brothers
to come forward and agree to lead the authorities
to the tomb.</p>

<p>Maspero, back in Cairo, sent an Egyptologist
with an assistant hot-foot to Thebes. A rendezvous
was fixed at Deir-el-Bahari. Picking their way over
the rocks, the Arabs led the two strangers along the
foot of the escarpment which frowned bare and
sinister above their heads. In a short while they
came to a boulder which had fallen from the cliffs
above. Screened in the most remarkable manner
by this mighty rock, the entrance had escaped
human eyes for three thousand years. Arabs and
strangers lit their candles, a rope was uncoiled and
shaken down the black shaft, and one after another
they slid down 40 feet to the bottom.</p>

<p>The strangers groped their way along a tunnel,
following the flickering candles just ahead, stooping
to escape the rocky ceiling, at times almost having
to go down on their hands and knees. They turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
a corner, still groping and climbing along the rocky
passage, down a flight of rock-cut stairs, deeper and
deeper into the recesses of the mountain, kicking
against bits of mummy cases, fragments of bandages.
On they went, their excitement rising with every
step.</p>

<p>At last they came to a chamber in the rock. It
was like an Aladdin’s cave. Mummy cases were
everywhere, standing up against the wall, lying
down and piled on top of each other. Great piles
of boxes, alabaster vases, statuettes—it was incredible,
absolutely amazing.</p>

<p>Without giving the newcomers time to take in
the wonderful sight, the Arabs led the way through
this chamber down and down through another
passage. After traversing 60 yards they came
to a chamber that was even more amazing, more
wonderful than the last. The strangers could
hardly believe their eyes. All around the burial
chamber were royal mummies, the glitter of gold
and colour showing up under the flickering candles.
The cases were exquisitely carved and decorated,
so well preserved that it was as though they were
made but yesterday.</p>

<p>So intensely excited was the Egyptologist, that it
required an effort of will to make him realize this
was not a dream, but reality, that he was the first
white man in the history of the world to gaze on
such a glorious sight; to see the ancient kings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
and queens as they had slumbered through the
centuries.</p>

<p>He looked around him, examined the royal
names and titles. Here were Seti <span class="allsmcap">I</span>, Thothmes <span class="allsmcap">II</span>,
Thothmes <span class="allsmcap">III</span>, Rameses <span class="allsmcap">II</span>. Wherever he looked the
mummy of a king or queen greeted his astonished
gaze. He was literally astounded, hardly able to
take it all in. The magnitude of the find overwhelmed
him. He counted the mummies one by
one—eleven kings, nine queens, a prince and a
princess! It was unbelievable.</p>

<p>In a little while, when the first excitement had
passed away, he became the man of action once
more. Realizing to the full that only the promptest
measures could save the tomb from being looted,
he quickly collected three hundred Arabs, and he
and his assistant began to remove the treasures.
They never halted, never rested, labouring on all
through that day and the next without a moment’s
sleep, removing the kings and queens from their
resting-place, sewing them up in sailcloth, and
getting them into the open. In forty-eight hours
they cleared the tomb of everything it contained,
and in another three days they had conveyed
the mummies over the plain of Thebes to the
Nile.</p>

<p>The natives were ugly, threatening, angry that
their kings should be disturbed—still more angry
that there was no chance for them to plunder the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
tomb any more. Not for a moment dared the
Egyptologist and his assistant leave their precious
charge, not until the steamer arrived that was to
take the royal mummies down to Cairo.</p>

<p>The news of the discovery spread like wildfire
through the villages, and as the steamer passed
slowly down the Nile, the Egyptian women hailed
the passing with the death wail, running along the
banks, tearing their hair and uttering their awful
cries. Men wailed and fired their guns. It was one
of the most remarkable sights ever witnessed, the
natives of our own time mourning the Pharaohs
who reigned thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>It was the triumph of a man whose whole life
was wrapped up in the past life of Egypt, whose
own life was as romantic as that of any man who
was destined to throw a little light upon the dead
civilizations of the Pharaohs. Maspero was but a
boy of fourteen when he was attracted by some of
the ancient picture-writing of the Egyptians. The
queer little figures exercised a strange spell over
him. He was quite fascinated by them, so much so,
that he made up his boyish mind to learn to read
them.</p>

<p>Probably hundreds of thousands of boys have seen
pictures of the hieroglyphics and thought them very
funny, but who has heard of another boy who was
so anxious to read them that he studied them at
any and every opportunity, as Gaston Maspero did?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
He who seeks knowledge will always find some way
of acquiring it. Gaston Maspero studied the picture-writing
to such good purpose that he learned to read
it quite easily and translate it with considerable
skill. He used to read the pictures to his school
friends, and they were considerably impressed by
this ability.</p>

<p>One night in 1867, some of Maspero’s fellow-students
were having dinner with their tutor, and
Mariette, the famous Egyptologist, was present.
Naturally the talk turned on Egypt, and the
students tried to impress Mariette by mentioning
that Maspero could read hieroglyphics, and that he
had taught himself.</p>

<p>Mariette was amused at the idea. “Ask him to
read this for me,” he said, and gave them an inscription
he had just discovered and which had not
been translated.</p>

<p>Maspero’s companions took the inscription, and
Maspero sat down and translated it. When
Mariette received the translation he was far more
amazed at finding this young man of twenty-one in
Paris who could read hieroglyphics, than he would
have been at finding some new temple on the Nile.
It seemed to him simply incredible, so he gave
Maspero something else to translate—lines that
were all mutilated and from which a great deal
was missing.</p>

<p>Maspero sat down to the problem, and after a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
days managed to translate the fragments and supply
the missing parts. Then Mariette realized that he
had indeed found a born Egyptologist, and it is not
surprising that the boy who was so interested that
he taught himself to read the picture-writing should
succeed Mariette in Egypt.</p>

<p>Who knows what Mariette thought when the
translations of Maspero were brought to him?
Perhaps his mind flashed back over the years to the
rather unhappy time when he, a lad of eighteen,
was professor of French at a school in Stratford-on-Avon,
to the days when his talent for drawing was
confined to designing ribbons for a Coventry manufacturer.
Maybe he remembered how happily he
returned to France to take his degree at Douai,
those articles he wrote to add to his income, the
cousin who had been dealing with Champollion’s
material, and whose death brought all the material
of that great man under Mariette’s own fingers.</p>

<p>From that period dates Mariette’s own romantic
career. He was under thirty when he went to
Egypt in search of manuscripts, and found instead
the ruins of the Serapeum at Memphis. His diggers
fought the desert, and rescued the Sphinx from the
grasping sands, tore the drift of centuries from the
ruins of the temples of Edfu, uncovered the glories of
Karnak. The years brought more discoveries, his
work was acclaimed, honours were heaped upon
him. The call of Egypt to Mariette was irresistible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
as it had been to Champollion, as it was to Maspero.
Fate linked these three Frenchmen together to add
to our knowledge of the past. They loved France,
but the deserts and the debris of Egypt became part
of their lives.</p>

<p>Often they went in the burning sun to the Valley
of the Tombs of the Kings—one of the most desolate
places on earth. Not a tree to be seen, not a flower,
not even a blade of grass. Vegetation cannot live
there. It is a veritable valley of the dead, an inferno
of desolation. Birds avoid it, animals shun it, only
the bats haunt the tombs. There at the base of the
hills is the wonderful temple of Queen Hatshepsut,
with its rows of pillars standing like sentinels before
the blackness which is beyond. Years ago no trace
of it could be seen, but a man with a spade came
along and found it, and after prodigious labours it
was dug out of the overlying rubble and rock in
which it was buried.</p>

<p>Everywhere is the eternal rubble and sand.
Huge piles of debris mark the sites where the diggers
have been working; broken steps leading downwards
into the mountains indicate where tombs
have been found.</p>

<p>Rain hardly ever falls there.... If you sat and
waited for a shower of rain, you would have to wait
on an average for five years! Perhaps twenty times
in a century the clouds break over the Valley of the
Tombs of the Kings, but the ground is so parched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>and rocky that a deluge is almost swallowed up
as it falls. In an hour the valley is again as dry
as a bone.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>The valley leads nowhere, except into the desert.
There was nothing to call the natives in that direction.
It was like a lonely valley in another world,
and this loneliness no doubt was one of the factors
which decided the Pharaohs to seek their last
resting-places here. Another factor was that the
limestone of the hills was an excellent stone in which
to cut the chambers which were to be the eternal
homes of the kings.</p>

<p>All their thought, all their secrecy to keep their
tombs inviolate, was in vain. The most trusted
men were chosen to carve out these underground
chambers, but where many men are engaged on
a secret mission, the secret is bound to leak
out.</p>

<p>Some of the workers may have told their wives,
who in turn may have dropped a remark in all
innocence which led the robbers to the exact spot.
The workers themselves, despite the faith of their
masters, were not always to be trusted, and there is
little doubt that some of them led the thieves to the
tombs and told them exactly where and how to break
in, that in some cases the very men who had built
the tombs came back afterwards by night and
plundered them.</p>

<p>It may easily have been the builders who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
robbed the tomb of Tutankhamen, for Mr. Carter
discovered that the thieves entered within a few
years of the King’s burial, and that the tomb was
then resealed by the keepers of the royal burial-places.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">The</span> romance of ancient Egypt is not nearly
told. Hundreds of volumes have been
written about it; hundreds more are still
to write. Day by day something is being turned up
under the spade to increase our knowledge of those
far-off times, and though we know more than the
people of a century ago, our present knowledge will
probably prove trifling compared with the knowledge
of a century hence.</p>

<p>For years the French, favoured by important
digging concessions, made many fine discoveries,
among them those of Mariette who, going up to
Thebes, saw a few columns sticking out of the sand
at Karnak and began to excavate the site. Most
men would have quailed before the gigantic task,
but Mariette set his diggers to work, and slowly but
surely rescued from the clutches of the desert all
that remained of one of the most remarkable temples
in the world. Mountains of sand and broken rock
were shifted, not by mammoth machines that dug
out a truck-load of sand at once, but by natives who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
shovelled it into baskets and ran off with it, seven
pounds at a time!</p>

<p>When Mariette returned to Egypt with Louis
Napoleon some years later, the Egyptologist was
as keen on the work as ever. He again began to
excavate, and among other things found a statue
representing the god Ammon, in whose honour the
temple at Karnak was originally built. Standing
by the knee of the god was a headless figure, said
to be that of Tutankhamen in his boyhood.</p>

<p>Mariette, well knowing the value of the group,
showed his regard for Prince Napoleon by making
him a present of the statue, and the Prince, fired
by what he saw in Egypt, and no doubt by
Mariette’s enthusiasm, started to collect things
Egyptian.</p>

<p>The time came when Prince Napoleon made up
his mind to sell his Egyptian treasures. He sold
many things, but no one would look at the statue,
so it was bought in at the sale for £20. For long it
remained in the Prince’s château, until a dealer
eventually acquired it for a trifling sum. Quickly
assuring himself of the antiquity of the statue, the
dealer went to the Louvre to offer the piece to the
nation.</p>

<p>The authorities inquired the price.</p>

<p>“I have been offered 300,000 francs by an
American, but I would rather let France have it
for 250,000 francs,” was the reply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>It was true. An American had offered £12,000
for the despised statue, which no one would buy
at the original sale, the same statue which the
Louvre gladly acquired for £10,000.</p>

<p>Museums will pay almost anything for fine
specimens that throw some light on past ages.
They will willingly fit out special expeditions to
various parts of the world. Often museums cooperate
in working a site, as in the case of the
Temple of the Moon God at Ur, in Mesopotamia, which
has been worked by the University Museum of Philadelphia
and the British Museum. The Americans
are indeed taking an increasing interest in digging
up the past, and they have many fine discoveries
to their credit, not least among them being the
finding of the famous Nippur tablets in Mesopotamia,
tablets which now grace the museum
at Philadelphia. Theodore Davis, too, has done
splendid work in the Nile Valley, and found
several important tombs, among them that of
Thothmes IV.</p>

<p>Yet, since men began to dig in Egypt, no tomb
has revealed so many treasures as that of Tutankhamen.
The value of the contents of the tomb,
with its lion-couches and chariots and alabaster
statues and vases, is computed at £3,000,000.
It is indeed impossible to fix the monetary worth
of such things. All that can be said is that their
value to science is incalculable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>This is by no means the first big find to be made
by Mr. Howard Carter, for years ago he revealed
the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut, whose temple is
one of the sights of the Valley of the Kings. The
entrance to her tomb, high up on the face of the
rocky hillside, led to a gallery winding round and
round like a corkscrew. The builders of the tomb
must have had a terrible time, for they unluckily
selected a very bad spot, where the rock was soft,
and so they were driven to go down and down,
until they hit on a place where the rock was hard
enough to serve for the burial chamber. Here
the chamber was hewn out of the rock, and
here it was found by Mr. Howard Carter several
thousand years later, after the usual thieves had
plundered it. The stench and heat were almost
overpowering.</p>

<p>Mr. Howard Carter is more familiar with
Thebes than most Londoners are with London. At
one time he was Inspector-General of Antiquities
there, so it will be realized that his knowledge of
the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings is quite
exceptional, and that it was something more
than good luck which led him to his greatest find
of all.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how trifles sometimes lead to
big discoveries. For instance, when Professor
Flinders Petrie was at Gizeh in the ’eighties, an
Arab offered to sell him part of an alabaster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
statuette. Instantly Petrie recognized it as a
very early Greek work.</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?” he asked.</p>

<p>The Arab told him, and at the first opportunity
the Egyptologist took the train to the nearest
point. For 20 miles he trudged over the country,
often going astray, but coming in the end to
many mounds in the desert. Countless fragments
of early Greek pottery furnished Petrie with all
the evidence he needed. Quickly filling his
pockets, he started on his long walk back to the
train.</p>

<p>The following year he returned to the mounds.
His first task was to find a shelter. He had barely
done this when he noticed two stones lying just
outside. He stooped and turned one over, to find
it was a proclamation of the long-lost city of
Naukratis carved in Greek characters, a city which
men had eagerly sought, a city the very existence
of which some men doubted. It was a sudden
revelation, a mighty discovery to spring from a
little alabaster statue, and it provides one more
indication of the genius of its discoverer.</p>

<p>Perhaps the weirdest experience in all Egyptology
was Petrie’s discovery of the noble Horuta at
Hawara down a well 40 feet deep. Here in a flooded
chamber, amid impenetrable blackness, he and his
labourers wrestled continually with mighty blocks,
in order to get to the stone sarcophagus which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
suspected was there. They found it at last, with
the lid barely peeping above the surface of the icy
water.</p>

<p>For days they strove to shift it, but it was immovable,
so he decided to cut the sarcophagus
in halves in order to get at the inner coffin. Weeks
of fatiguing labour saw this gigantic task accomplished,
and there was another desperate fight,
with men working up to their chests in water,
to get it out.</p>

<p>Instead of the coveted head-end of the sarcophagus,
the foot-end came to light. It was a
terrible disappointment. The coffin still remained
in the other half, and was apparently as far
off as ever. The Egyptologist, groping in the
murky water, fought with it, strove to shift
it with his hands, with his feet. It was firmly
fixed.</p>

<p>Still he was not beaten. After a sustained effort
lasting several days, he and his workers managed
to raise the lid of the other half of the sarcophagus
with wedges, until the inside of it was a few inches
above water-level. Then he wriggled inside, and
for hours in the darkness he sat astride the coffin
and struggled to loosen it. The top of his head
touched the lid of the sarcophagus, he had hardly
room to move at all, the water came up to his mouth
and compelled him to breathe through his nose.
More than once in the course of his tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
exertions he took in a mouthful of the nauseous
water. The sand clung to the coffin as though
it were set in a bed of cement. He tried scraping
away the sand with his feet, he prised at the coffin
with crowbars. All his efforts failed to shift it a
fraction of an inch.</p>

<p>Few men would have continued under such
hopeless conditions; most would have acknowledged
defeat and betaken themselves to an easier task.
But Flinders Petrie was possessed of a determination
that would not be denied. He set to work
drilling holes in the coffin—a most difficult feat.
When this was done bolts were inserted, strong
ropes were attached, and the men went along the
passage and hauled away with all their strength.
For a time it was like heaving at a mountain, then
the coffin stirred slightly, moved more and more.
Backs were bending under the strain, arms almost
cracking as the men taking part in that fantastic
tug-of-war with a dead man finally triumphed and
dragged the water-blackened coffin out of the
depths.</p>

<p>Breathlessly they opened it, found the mummy of
Horuta, “wrapped in a network of lapis lazuli,
beryl, and silver.... Bit by bit the layers of pitch
and cloth were loosened, and row after row of
magnificent amulets were disclosed, just as they
were laid on in the distant past. The gold ring on
his finger which bore his name and titles, the exquisitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
inlaid gold birds, the chased gold figures,
the lazuli statuettes, the polished lazuli and beryl
and carnelian amulets finely engraved.”</p>

<p>Forgotten were the herculean labours of the past
months, forgotten the icy water that froze their
bodies, the blackness that blinded them, swept
away by the sight of the treasures disclosed to their
delighted eyes, the treasures for which they had
endured so much and fought so long. The recovery
of the mummy of Horuta is one of the epics of the
Nile.</p>

<p>The world-famous tablets of Tell el Amarna were
accidentally discovered by an Arab woman, who
happened on them while searching the ruins for
trifles to sell to tourists. The tablets were letters
sent by the King of Babylon to the King of Egypt,
written in the usual cuneiform characters on slabs
of clay, and they disclose much concerning the life
of that time. A remarkable thing is that in one of
the letters, the King of Babylon mentions that he
is sending a present of some couches to the King
of Egypt, and the discovery of the tomb of
Tutankhamen has brought to light what appear
to be the very couches which were presented
to the King of Egypt nearly four thousand years
ago.</p>

<p>Professor Petrie has little doubt that the strange
lion-couches are of Babylonian origin, and that
these are the couches referred to in the Tell el<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
Amarna letters. The couches found in Tutankhamen’s
tomb are secured with bronze clasps. The
Babylonians secured their furniture in this way,
but the Egyptians never did, for in the Nile
valley the furniture was held together with wooden
pegs; so the evidence distinctly favours the view
that these are indeed the Babylonian couches
mentioned.</p>

<p>Lord Carnarvon, in a lecture at the Central Hall,
Westminster, gave a vivid account of the opening
of the tomb, telling how they cleared the passage
leading to the first chamber, how they broke a hole
through the sealed wall just large enough to see
through, how Mr. Howard Carter held up his candle
and peered into the tomb, uttering no word. All
the time Lord Carnarvon was on tenterhooks,
wondering what was behind the wall. A moment
later he peered through, and saw one of the
most wonderful sights that has ever greeted an
excavator.</p>

<p>To come on such a wealth of treasure is actually
a grave responsibility. Before now men have seen
statues suddenly collapse into dust before their
amazed eyes, have watched brilliantly decorated
mummy cases crumble without warning into heaps
of powder.</p>

<p>A most dramatic incident occurred after the
unique discovery of all the royal mummies in 1881.
Exercising the utmost care, Maspero slowly unwrapped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
one of the mummies in order to gaze on
the actual features of the dead monarch. A camera
was focused, the plate exposed, and even as the
photograph was taken the face vanished into
nothingness. Maspero was terribly upset at the
loss of the mummy, so upset that he refused to allow
the mummy of Rameses the Great to be unwrapped,
for fear it, too, should vanish.</p>

<p>For things cannot last for ever, even in the dry
air of Egypt. They cannot spend thousands of
years in tombs without becoming fragile. Their
preservation is therefore imperative. Everything
must be photographed from many angles, in order
to provide a complete record in pictures. In the
case of the treasures of Tutankhamen, electric
lamps of 2000 candle-power were installed in the
tomb, for the use of the photographer. Paraffin
wax, dissolved celluloid, sheets of glass, various
acids, are used to prevent decay.</p>

<p>Even when all precautions are taken, things have
to be very carefully handled. They literally need
wrapping in cotton wool, and one of Lord Carnarvon’s
first purchases, when he saw the extent of his
discovery, was a mile and a half of cotton wool to
wrap round the treasures.</p>

<p>As far back as 1888, Flinders Petrie was confronted
by the problem of preserving a coffin
from which the stucco was peeling. After much
consideration, he dropped melted paraffin wax
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>on the weak spots, and thought he had solved
the difficulty. To his dismay the wax made
matters worse. The outer margins of the wax
contracted in cooling, and formed saucer-like
depressions which pulled the stucco away from
the wood.</p>

<p>He was so gravely concerned that for days
he racked his brains to find a remedy. At last,
he took a brazier full of glowing charcoal, and
held it near the waxen saucers. To his joy
he saw the wax melting into the cracks and
under the stucco, cementing it firmly to the
wood again.</p>

<p>Nowhere else on this earth are the past and
present so intermixed as at Thebes. Here extreme
antiquity may be seen side by side with
modern science, motor-cars passing asses, and
electricity illuminating the ancient tombs. The
mummy of Seti <span class="allsmcap">II</span> lies with an electric light
above his head, so that visitors may have no
difficulty in gazing on his features!</p>

<p>The remarkable paintings in the tombs are
executed so skilfully, the outlines are drawn and
coloured so correctly, that the possibility of doing
such work in the darkness of an underground
chamber has often been questioned. More than
once it has been said that the light of torches or
candles would be quite inadequate, and it has
been suggested that the Egyptians may have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
anticipated modern science by using electric light
thousands of years ago.</p>

<p>That the Egyptians were clever is beyond all
doubt, that they may have known things of which
we to-day are ignorant is more than possible, but
the decorations of the tombs are no evidence that
they were conversant with the use of electricity.
The ancient methods of lighting the tombs so that
the artists could see to work were after all quite
simple. The artists worked by the light of the
sun. The sun might be perhaps a hundred feet or
more away along a passage, yet a white garment
would serve excellently for reflecting the light into
the tomb.</p>

<p>Professor Flinders Petrie has worked wonders
with the lid of a biscuit box, and in bygone days a
man might often have been seen holding a tin lid
at the mouth of a tunnel leading into a tomb,
deflecting the ray of light right into the tomb, to
enable the Egyptologist to take photographs. If
the lid of a biscuit box happened to be missing,
then a turkish towel was made to serve the same
purpose. The actinic qualities of the sun in the
Nile valley are indeed remarkable.</p>

<p>Many things have turned up under the spade in
Egypt, wonderful stone vases, jars with faint
traces of perfume still pervading them, slate palettes
on which the people mixed the paints with which
they touched up their eyes and faces. While the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
Ancient Britons were painting themselves with woad,
the Egyptian ladies were sitting at their dressing-tables
making up their eyes in quite the modern
fashion, the Egyptian children were playing with
toys such as the children play with to-day. The
Egyptian forerunner of Pepys carved his diary on
a piece of ebony, one page to a whole year!</p>

<p>Glass was in use in Egypt thousands of years
before it was heard of in Europe; Egypt taught
the world the use of bronze; and the flint implements
found on the banks of the Nile are finer
than any others so far discovered in the world.
Some of the knives of the best period are simply
marvellous and disclose extraordinary skill on the
part of the Egyptian flint workers. There are
stone knives in the British Museum with teeth as
regular and as fine as those of a modern, machine-cut
fret saw, teeth so minute as to be almost invisible
to the naked eye. One masterpiece of a
flint knife, cleverly flaked in the most remarkable
manner, has about fifty tiny teeth to the inch, and
it is astounding to think that such amazing hand
work was performed by the Egyptians of the Stone
Age. Probably there is not a living man who could
duplicate such work.</p>

<p>Now the treasures of Tutankhamen grip the
imagination and dazzle the eye. Tutankhamen
made a priceless, a magnificent gift to posterity,
yet it is to Ptolemy v. that we owe the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
gift of all. The gift is merely that broken stone
in the British Museum, the stone which was dug
out of the ruins of Fort St. Julian in 1798. In
causing that stone to be carved, Ptolemy presented
us with the key to the knowledge of ancient
Egypt.</p>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Countless</span> caravans wended their way
from the parched plains of Mesopotamia
eastwards over the Persian border, past
Kermanshah, winding along the road that skirts
the range of hills rising to the left, and so through
Behistun, a mere collection of huts with a name
that is famous throughout all the seats of learning
in the world. Here the caravans halted while
men and beasts slaked their thirst in the pool, but
few of the travellers troubled to look a second time
at the great stone of Behistun rising above the
plain. Users of the road were ever more interested
in the spring than in the figures sculptured in the
rock.</p>

<p>The carvings were old—as old as the hills—and
like the hills they became part of the landscape.
They were legendary, carved, so people said, by the
gods in the dim past. Age-old myths concerning
them were poured into the ear of the stranger who
passed that way, but those who used the road
regularly, and those who dwelt in the neighbourhood,
took no more notice of the rock carvings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
Behistun than they took of the other features of
the scenery. The most aged man was as ignorant
of the origin of the carvings as was the youngest
stripling.</p>

<p>There the figures stood for centuries, for thousands
of years. The traders drove their animals along
the road to the sound of jingling bells, quaffed the
waters of the spring, and passed onward, much more
concerned about their merchandise than about
the carvings on the bluff.</p>

<p>Had the figures been more accessible, they would
have vanished long ago. Senseless wanderers
would have taken pleasure in smashing them, and
rain and frost and sun would have completed the
destruction. But the figures were carved too high,
and the rock below had been cut away by the masons
of old, leaving a perpendicular wall which could
only be scaled at considerable risk. Above them
was the sheer cliff. There was no way down to
them, no easy way up to them. The escarpment
on which they were carved rose for 1700 feet, and
they were graved out of the living rock 300 feet
above the ground.</p>

<p>Except for a few travellers’ tales, the carvings at
Behistun were unknown to the teeming multitudes
dwelling in the great cities. Few men would have
thought of looking in this lonely spot in Persia for
the lost key to Babylon and Assyria. Yet here
was the key for the man who had the courage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
determination to wrest it from the mountains.
Such a man came in the end, over two thousand four
hundred years after the ancient sculptors had
carved the last figure and removed the last
scaffolding.</p>

<p>The discovery of the key to Egyptian hieroglyphics,
and the discovery of the key to cuneiform
writing, resemble each other in more ways than
one. It will be remembered that a soldier found
the Rosetta Stone, and that an Englishman was
the first man to indicate the manner of reading it.
Rawlinson, whose genius solved the puzzle of
Persian cuneiform, was also a soldier and an
Englishman. It seems strange that science
should be indebted to a doctor and a soldier
for lifting the curtains of the past, that scholars
who had spent their lives studying foreign
languages should have to rely upon two men
to whom these things were just an absorbing
hobby.</p>

<p>When Henry Rawlinson sailed for Bombay to
enter the service of the East India Company in
1827, he was only seventeen years old. Blessed
with an uncanny knack for learning languages, he
found this ability stood him in good stead upon
his arrival in India. Where other men were beaten
by native dialects, he took to them as a duck
takes to water. Before he was twenty, he was one
of the interpreters for the army of the East India<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
Company, and long before he was thirty he could
speak Persian like a native.</p>

<p>His remarkable abilities stamped him as a man
who would go far, as one destined to play many
parts in the ever-changing East. For a time he
concentrated his energies on reorganizing the
Persian army; at other periods he was frequenting
the courts of the Shah and the Amir
of Afghanistan, filling the intervals with hard
fighting, a good deal of administration, and the
pleasure that lay nearest his heart—the study of
dialects.</p>

<p>The Orient cast a spell over him, and the legends
of Persia particularly appealed to his imagination.
He was in the land where history began. The
past called to him. Little bits of burnt brick
with strange marks on them intrigued him. It
was as though a robin had hopped all over them
while they were wet, and had left behind impressions
something like a bird leaves in the snow.
He knew these fragments were the old writings,
though they were like no known writings on earth,
and at last he made up his mind to see if he could
find the key to the cuneiform characters.</p>

<p>In 1835 Rawlinson, then a young man of twenty-five,
took up his residence at Kermanshah, as
commander of all the troops in the province.
Behistun was no more than 20 miles away,
and something must have told the soldier that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
here was the key to the riddle he sought. So,
when opportunity served, he jogged along the
old road to the rock of Behistun, and began to
copy the inscription. He had no rope, no ladder
to assist him. All he had to rely upon were his
own sure feet and strong hands. A slip meant
certain death, yet the risk sat so lightly on his
shoulders that he made his dangerous way up
and down the precipice three and four times
a day.</p>

<p>There came a time when ladders were absolutely
essential to secure the copies he needed. So narrow
was the ledge at the foot of the sculptures that
Rawlinson was forced to place his ladder almost
perpendicularly against the face of the rock. For
long periods he perched in a most precarious
position at the top of the ladder and glued himself
to the rock. The least little movement outwards
on his part and the ladder would have overbalanced
and plunged with him to destruction.
He knew it, yet he continued his work
as calmly as though he were at a desk instead
of standing on a crazy ladder at the edge of a
precipice.</p>

<p>On one never-to-be-forgotten occasion he escaped
death by a miracle. He sought with his ladder
to bridge a chasm in order to copy other inscriptions,
but the formation of the rock made it
impossible to place the ladder flat. Eventually,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
after some trouble, he arranged the ladder with
one side resting firmly on each opposing rocky
ledge, while the other side hung free immediately
below.</p>

<p>Standing on the lower side, he took hold of the
upper side of the ladder with his hands and started
to walk across. Suddenly, without warning, the
lower side of the ladder with all the rungs broke
away from the upper side and dropped into the
dizzy chasm. Rawlinson, as he fell, clung
desperately to the top side of the ruined ladder.
For a brief moment he swung on the verge of
a terrible death, then, hand over hand, he made
his way back to safety. In the end he managed
to copy the Persian and Median inscriptions,
but the other inscription in Babylonian on the
outjutting rock defeated all his efforts to
reach it.</p>

<p>For three years he studied his inscriptions, and
began to lay their secrets bare. The first draft of
his great work was written. Then duty called
him elsewhere, and the Afghan War put an end
to his studies, compelling him to lay his book
aside.</p>

<p>It was 1844 before he was able to resume the
work he was so anxious to do. That year saw him
appointed British Consul at Baghdad, and he took
up his residence in the city on the Tigris and his
studies at the same time. He was once more in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the neighbourhood of Behistun, and eventually he
made his plans for procuring a copy of the
Babylonian inscription which had defeated him
years before.</p>

<p>Riding along the old highway to Behistun, he
carried with him this time much rope and many
sheets of thick paper. He studied the well-known
rock from below. There was the long line of
figures carved in the limestone, to their left the
series of inscriptions cut in column. A little above,
on the slanting rock, was the inscription he desired.
Through a telescope he could make out the inscriptions
he had already copied, but he needed the
wings of an eagle to lift him to the other rock.
He made his way round the top of the bluff, studying
it from all angles, and concluded that it was
impossible for him to obtain a copy of the last
inscription.</p>

<p>He inquired among the Kurdish peasants for
one who would climb up to the rock and make a
copy in the way he directed. He offered a good
reward, but the peasants shook their heads. They
considered the feat impossible. Rawlinson, paying
no heed, pushed his inquiries further afield, and at
last came on a Kurdish boy who willingly undertook
the task.</p>

<p>The lad was lithe, agile, sure-footed as a chamois,
and he climbed up to the platform in front of the
sculptures with little trouble. Equipping himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
with some ropes and pegs and a hammer, he
gazed up at his objective. The rock jutted
outwards over the sheer precipice; it seemed
impossible for anything but a fly to crawl
over its face. For a little while the keen eyes
of the lad sought for handholds and footholds;
then he squeezed himself into a crevice at the
side of the big rock and began to worm his way
upward.</p>

<p>Rawlinson gazed on while the lad mounted a foot
at a time. Often the climber stopped while his
fingers sought another hold, then he progressed a
little higher. But at last even he came to a stop;
he was unable to go on.</p>

<p>Reaching above his head, he drove one of the
wooden pegs deep down into the soil covering the
rock. Attaching a rope to it, he tested it, pulling
this way and that, to make sure that the peg held
firmly.</p>

<p>The onlookers watched with bated breath as the
lad attached himself to the end of the rope, as he
tried to swing himself across to the other side of
the rock, clinging with hands and feet to the rocky
surface, with death yawning for him below. Failure
met his gallant attempt. Once more he tried,
swinging over the rock face, with only a rope between
himself and Eternity. Ten, fifteen, twenty feet he
traversed, to find that further progress was impossible.
Quickly reaching out, he drove another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
peg deep down into the soil above his head, as
quickly attached a rope. The fixing of a seat to
the ends of the two ropes to form a cradle was not
very difficult, and sitting in this cradle the lad was
able to go all over the rock, taking impressions of
the inscription under Rawlinson’s direction on sheets
of damp paper. In ten days the task was finished,
and Rawlinson possessed the first complete copy
of the cuneiform inscriptions at Behistun ever held
in the hands of man.</p>

<p>The supreme task of deciphering these inscriptions
occupied Rawlinson on and off for many
years. As already mentioned, the first draft of his
book on the inscriptions was finished before he left
Kermanshah; and when he came to the consulate
at Baghdad he threw himself heart and soul into
making a complete revision of his draft to embody
his later studies and knowledge. Often in the
intense heat he worked in a summer-house at the
bottom of the garden, a pet lion lying at his feet,
and a water-wheel from the river Tigris pouring
water over the roof of the summer-house to keep
it cool.</p>

<p>There was the Greek script to assist Young and
Champollion to decipher the hieroglyphics of the
Rosetta Stone, but there was no known writing at
all in the inscriptions at Behistun. There were
three inscriptions carved on the rock face, Persian,
Babylonian and Median cuneiform. The clue to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
them was lost. No living race wrote in such a
manner, and not a single man knew how to
read the curious wedge-shaped writing of the
ancients.</p>

<p>Rawlinson therefore laboured under a much
bigger handicap than that imposed on Young and
Champollion. But Rawlinson was one of those
men to whom a handicap means something to be
surmounted. The bigger the handicap, the greater
the satisfaction in overcoming it. The inscriptions
at Behistun seemed to challenge him, to defy him
to read them, as from their lofty pinnacle they had
challenged men for ages past.</p>

<p>Rawlinson was the man in a million. The lure
of the past and the fascination of the East spurred
him on to do the impossible. His courage was
as great as his knowledge of dialects was
profound. It was no hope of reward, of glory,
that urged him to wrest the secret from his
sheets of paper impressions. It was the desire
to pit his brain against the baffling writing, to
master it.</p>

<p>Grotefend years before had pointed the way, but
Rawlinson was ignorant of this fact. All the
years that Rawlinson was writing and studying at
Baghdad, an Irish clergyman, Dr. Hincks, was
engaged on the same mighty task in a quiet rectory
in Ireland, solving the puzzle which Rawlinson had
already solved. Other men were wrestling with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
the same difficulties, but Rawlinson knew absolutely
nothing of them or their endeavours. He
worked away incessantly, relying upon himself
alone. He studied the queer, wedge-shaped impressions
for months, noted their resemblances,
found the characters that were repeated, and
little by little, a character at a time, he built
up that dead language, succeeded in reading the
writing of the peoples who inhabited Persia and
the plains of Mesopotamia long before the birth
of Christ.</p>

<p>In 1846 his great book, giving his reading of the
inscriptions at Behistun, was published in London
by the Royal Asiatic Society. The scientific world
was astounded. People thought such a thing
impossible. Many imagined that Rawlinson had
invented some sort of reading of his own for
the cuneiform characters. They reasoned that as
there was no guide whatsoever, no man could ever
read them.</p>

<p>They reasoned wrongly, as time was to prove.
The unearthing in Mesopotamia of a romantic
cylinder of clay, all covered with arrow-headed
characters, brought the longed-for opportunity of
testing whether Rawlinson was right or wrong,
whether he had indeed solved the mystery.</p>

<p>Copies of the cylinder were given to four men
who had learned to read cuneiform writing, among
them Rawlinson. Each was asked to make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
translation, and to submit it to the authorities of
the British Museum. The four translations were
made, and the authorities sat down and compared
them.</p>

<p>Each translation told the same story of Tiglath-pileser,
gave the same names and dates! It
was a wonderful triumph for Rawlinson, for it
proved beyond all doubt that he had indeed
solved the mystery of the dead writing of Persia
and Babylon.</p>

<p>Rawlinson himself attributed his triumph to his
familiarity with the local Persian dialects; it was
his intimate knowledge of the languages spoken by
the peasants and tribes of Persia that enabled him
to get to the root of many of the words which so
sorely puzzled him. By the time he managed to
obtain his copy of the Babylonian inscription
through the aid of the little Kurdish boy, he had
already wrested the secret from the Persian inscription,
and his book had been published a
year.</p>

<p>He found the clue to cuneiform in the name of
two kings, just as Young found his first clue in
the name of Ptolemy. Before he bent his energies
on deciphering the Behistun inscriptions, he had
closely studied two other inscriptions which were
identical but for two words. Rawlinson, puzzling
over these words, at length concluded they were
the names of two kings, that one king was the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>father and the other the son. He reasoned correctly,
and thus obtained a clue to the inscriptions
at Behistun, the deciphering of which ranks
as one of the greatest achievements of the human
brain.</p>

DARIUS THE GREAT RECEIVING CAPTIVES OF WAR</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Over five hundred years before the birth of
Christ, Darius, King of Persia, caused an account
of his campaigns to be engraved on the rock in
Persian, Babylonian and Median, so that all men
who passed that way might read of the deeds of
the great king. A full-length portrait of the
monarch was carved in stone for posterity to gaze
on his features, and to add to his glory he was
shown receiving some of the prisoners captured
in his campaigns.</p>

<p>The remarkable skill shown by the Persian king
in selecting the site is proved by the fact that the
figures still exist, in spite of the storms beating on
them for two thousand four hundred years. Darius
was not ignorant of human nature. He knew full
well the tendency of man to destroy. To defeat this
tendency he had the rock cut away sheer to the
foot of the cliff, while to preserve his inscription from
the ravages of time he caused it all to be brushed
with a sort of yellow varnish, a varnish of such
unique quality that some of it protects the stone
to this very day.</p>

<p>We know much, can do many things. We fly
in the air, tunnel the mountains, travel beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
the sea. Yet there is still a little that is hidden
from us; and one thing of which we remain ignorant
is the secret of that old Persian varnish, which
will endure frost and hail and rain and shine for
twenty-four centuries.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">To</span> within a few years of the middle of
the nineteenth century, Babylon and
Assyria were only names. People read
about them in the Bible, but no visible trace
remained. They had vanished utterly from the
face of the earth. Some thinkers, who knew how
stories become distorted by the passage of time,
questioned if such places ever existed, whether
they were not just myths, the figments of the
imaginations of some ancient scribes.</p>

<p>The rivers Tigris and Euphrates flowed through
deserts. It seemed impossible that such lands
could once have been flowing with milk and honey,
that they could have supported a big population
and a high civilization.</p>

<p>Wandering Arabs roved the plains, encamping
where they listed, warring against the Sultan and
each other. They drove their sheep wherever the
scanty herbage offered them fodder. The spring
saw the desert blossom like the rose, the summer
sun changed it of a sudden to desolation, burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
up everything, sometimes leaving the tribes
struggling in the grip of famine.</p>

<p>Great mounds of sand stood up from the deserts
on each side of the rivers, hills on which the Arabs
used to set their black tents of goat hair, while
their flocks fed on the scanty grass that clothed
the mounds in spring. No sign was apparent of a
previous civilization; just the great mounds humping
out of the desert and the black tents of the Arabs.</p>

<p>Those who saw the mounds did not trouble their
heads about them. They took them for natural
hills. There was no reason for them to think
otherwise.</p>

<p>No one questioned why such hills should crop
suddenly out of the flat desert. The Arabs who set
up a village or two of mud huts on some of the
mounds did not ask themselves why they should
occasionally turn up bricks among the rubbish on
the hills. When things have been in existence
as long as the mounds on the Tigris, and when
bricks have been turned up as often as the Arabs
have unearthed them, these things are accepted
without question as a matter of course. Neither
Turks nor Arabs troubled about the mounds. It
was left to foreigners to prove that these lofty
eminences were the handiwork of man, and that
the mounds on the banks of the Tigris and the
Euphrates covered all that was left of Assyria and
Babylonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>In deciphering the stone of Behistun, Rawlinson
did wonderful work. He was but thirty-five when
he made the announcement that astounded the
scientific world. The credit of uncovering the
remains of ancient Assyria rests with Austin Henry
Layard, who started life by studying law, and
finished by making one of the greatest discoveries
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Layard’s whole life was one long romance. He
was endowed with a vivid imagination, which probably
came from his mixed descent, for his mother
was a Spanish lady and his father an Englishman.
As a young man, Layard was set to studying law,
but instead of attaining great legal honours, he
was made a baronet for wielding pick and spade
to such good purpose out in Mesopotamia, that he
dug up more knowledge of the past than any one
man before or since.</p>

<p>Layard in his teens read the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> with
avidity. All the colour, the romance of the East
appealed to his mind. He dreamed dreams of
bazaars and eastern palaces, with veiled ladies and
their lovers. While he dreamed these dreams he
was compelled to study musty legal documents, in
which he took not the slightest interest. Being
confined in an office he hated, his great desire was
to see the scenes he had read and dreamed about.
Yet there was no escape for him. His father had
chosen the law for him as a profession, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
he continued his studies against his own inclinations.</p>

<p>Working in his uncle’s office, Layard was not much
impressed by the imagination or the generosity of
his relative. Often when the lawyer thought his
nephew was studying in his room, Layard was chatting
with refugees, listening eagerly to their tales,
and filling his rooms with the smell of fried sprats.</p>

<p>His eagerness to travel and see the world was not
wholly unsatisfied. He visited the Continent once or
twice with a wealthy friend and saw much. There
came a day when he made up his mind to see the
land of the Tsars. He counted up his money. It
was little enough, but by exercising strict economy
he decided he might just manage to obtain another
glimpse of the world. So he set out practically on
the spur of the moment, and made his first acquaintance
with Russia and Scandinavia.</p>

<p>This adventurous young fellow was born with the
desire to wander and see new lands and peoples.
To a youth of his temperament, an office was a
prison. While he was poring over his law-books,
the figures of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> were flitting through
his brain. His whole life was practically influenced
by these tales of the East. “To them,” he wrote,
“I attribute that love of travel and adventure which
took me to the East, and led me to the discovery of
the ruins of Nineveh. They give the truest, most
lively and most interesting pictures of manners and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
customs which still existed amongst Turks, Persians
and Arabs when I first mixed freely with them.”</p>

<p>Despite this overwhelming desire to travel, he
grappled with his legal studies, and managed to pass
his final examination. At that time his uncle arrived
home from Ceylon, and it may be imagined how
delightedly the young man listened to accounts of
life in that far-off island. With his usual impetuosity
he determined to go to Ceylon, to take up
the profession he had studied.</p>

<p>“I will travel overland,” he said. De Lesseps
had still to carve the Suez Canal out of the desert
sands. Why should Layard coop himself up in a
ship and make his slow way all round Africa to
India? It was then the usual way, but the usual
way was not Layard’s way. He studied his maps
and traced his route. Travelling overland would
give him a splendid opportunity of seeing the world,
and he hugged the secret thought in his heart that
he would be able to wander in the lands of his
dreams, to see Constantinople and Baghdad.</p>

<p>He received £600 from his mother, to set him on
the road to fame and fortune. Half this sum was
sent to a bank in Ceylon so that he might collect it
on his arrival, the other half he carried with him to
pay his expenses on the long journey half across the
world. He was only twenty-two years old when
he said good-bye to his mother, and set out with a
friend in 1839 to make his way to Ceylon. By the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
autumn they were adventuring in Syria. They had
no one to guide them, no servants to wait on them.
They tended their own horses, and for the rest relied
on their youth and their weapons.</p>

<p>Layard’s thoughts turned in the direction of
Nineveh and Babylon, and his horse’s head was
turned in the same direction. He realized that the
opportunity of seeing the land might never recur.
So in the spring of 1840 the two friends jogged along
from Aleppo to Mosul. They were lucky to get
through unscathed, for the Arabs were warring with
each other on all sides. The dwellers of the deserts
were raiding right and left, and Layard often happened
on encampments that were picked clean by
the marauders. Once or twice the young Englishmen
came upon bands of the raiders, but their luck
stood them in good stead and they passed on their
way unmolested. The two friends made light of
these adventures, yet there was always the chance
that a bullet might stretch them dead on the desert
sands and that they would for ever disappear in the
East.</p>

<p>The great mounds of Nimroud, opposite Mosul,
wielded a potent spell over Layard. He climbed
about them, dreamed over them, picked up bits of
brick with arrow-headed writing on them. Often
he asked himself what lay under his feet. He saw
bits of alabaster sticking out of the soil where the
rains had washed them bare. The remains of a dam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>peeped out of the river Tigris. He asked an Arab
who built it.</p>

<br>

<p>“Nimrod,” said the Arab, referring to the great
mythical god of the past.</p>

<p>The stones of the dam were locked securely together.
The waters poured over it in a cataract.
Layard visioned the men in past ages building that
dam, saw the waters held back and flowing into the
canals to make the desert into a fertile plain. He
galloped over the desert and saw traces of the silted-up
canals, and he knew that the fertile land of the
past and the desolate land through which he rode
were one and the same. The neglect of man, the
passage of time, and the absence of water were
responsible for the change.</p>

<p>He left Mosul on a raft of goatskins, floating down
the Tigris to Baghdad as men had floated down
for thousands of years. As he glided by on the
slow-moving river the hillocks on the banks were
beckoning to him, and he vowed to lay bare the
past with a spade at the very first opportunity.</p>

<p>It was two years before that opportunity arrived.
When he got back to Mosul he found a Frenchman,
M. Botta, was digging. For a long time Botta found
little to encourage him to proceed with the work.
A few fragments of brick and other trifles were all
that turned up under the pick.</p>

<p>Then one day an Arab gazed down on the trenches
that Botta’s workmen were digging, wondering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
what on earth his compatriots from Mosul were
searching for, and why they were going to all the
trouble.</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” he asked at last.</p>

<p>The labourer who was digging straightened his
back, and glancing round among the rubbish he
had turned up, picked up a piece of brick with a
few cuneiform characters on it. “This,” he said.</p>

<p>The Arab laughed. It seemed to him a huge
joke that men should be wasting their time digging
in the earth for bits of broken brick. “Why, where
I live there are thousands of them,” he said. “We
find them when we are digging the foundations of
our houses.”</p>

<p>Botta was told what the peasant had said. The
Frenchman was very dubious. He had heard such
things before, and the rumours always proved
false. The diggers, however, were so insistent,
that at last he sent one or two off to the village of
Khorsabad, where the peasant lived, to see what
they could find.</p>

<p>It was some little time before the diggers could
persuade the villagers to allow them to sink a
test hole. Eventually, the inhabitants were won
over, and the excavators sank a shaft—which
quickly ended at the top of a mighty wall!</p>

<p>Hastening at once to the spot, Botta set his
men furiously to work. They unearthed an ancient
Assyrian palace. Great slabs of stone were covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
with sculptured scenes of war. Botta was astounded.
He, nor any other modern man, had
never seen the like.</p>

<p>They proved to be the ruins of a king’s palace,
but unfortunately as soon as they were laid bare
the slabs began to crumble. A huge fire had
destroyed the palace. In the heat the slabs were
reduced to lime, and directly they were uncovered
they fell in little pieces. Nothing could be done
to preserve them. They had remained hidden
for thousands of years. The kindly earth had kept
them intact, but directly the air played about them
they decayed.</p>

<p>Layard was for long in close touch with Botta.
More than once the Frenchman wrote to Layard
about his non-success, and Layard displayed his
fine character by urging the Frenchman to continue.</p>

<p>The Briton had studied the spot with a view to
working there. All thoughts of reaching Ceylon
had passed from his mind. He wrote to friends,
and tried to interest them in his proposed work.
He received no encouragement. Despite all this
disappointment, he was great enough to encourage
his rival. It throws considerable light on the
character of the man who eventually accomplished
so much on the banks of the Tigris.</p>

<p>If Layard did not make the first discovery there,
he had much to do with it. But for his encouragement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Botta might have ceased digging long before
the peasant stood looking down into his trenches,
to tell him that there were heaps of the funny old
bricks in his village of Khorsabad.</p>

<p>The influence of the Englishman, and the laughing
words of a peasant, led to the Frenchman
taking the first step back into the Assyria of the
past.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Layard,</span> disappointed that his own countrymen
were so little interested in his proposals,
was impelled by the success of
Botta to make a strong effort to begin the work
he was longing to do. Hastening to Constantinople,
he saw Sir Stratford Canning, the British Ambassador,
told him his plans, and succeeded in interesting
him to such an extent that the Ambassador advanced
the amount of £60.</p>

<p>It was a trivial sum with which to start excavating
the mounds of the Tigris, and not many men would
have undertaken the work with so little money
behind them. Layard did not hesitate for a moment.
He left Constantinople without breathing a word
about his intentions, and in less than a fortnight
was back in Mosul.</p>

<p>The country, through misrule, was very unsettled,
and the authorities were so antagonistic that
Layard dared not tell them of his project. He knew
that if he let fall the slightest word as to what
he was about, he would immediately be stopped.
Keeping his plans to himself, he collected one or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
two men and announced that he was going on an
expedition to shoot wild boars.</p>

<p>A raft was built, the goatskins were blown up
to support it, and Layard made a brave show of the
guns and spears he put aboard. The other hunting
weapons were so strange that he thought it prudent
to smuggle them on to the raft. They were, in fact,
picks and shovels!</p>

<p>It needed a man of resource to beat the wiles of
the Turks. Layard was certainly resourceful, and
anything more amusing than the way he set out
to hunt wild boar with picks and shovels would be
difficult to imagine. The raft was pushed out into
the stream, and for a few hours the hunters floated
slowly along, landing some distance from the mound
and spending the night with a party of Arabs.</p>

<p>Early next morning Layard set off with six
Arabs for the mound, and began collecting the
fragments of brick he saw lying about. The
collecting of these trifles was soon discarded for a
more important task which centred round a piece of
alabaster sticking out of the soil. The Arabs tugged
at it, Layard tried to drag it out, and as it remained
immovable, he set his men to dig it up. In a few
hours, many plain slabs of alabaster were laid
bare, and Layard knew he was on the track of the
lost civilization of Assyria.</p>

<p>He possessed a peculiar genius for the task he
had undertaken, while his insight in selecting spots<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
for his operations was almost uncanny. Where
Botta dug and found nothing, Layard dug later
and laid bare the most remarkable sculptures. As
he looked at the hills of desolation, he imagined
the palaces as they must have been in their glory,
and reasoned where the walls must have stood.
Sometimes he was wrong, but more often he was
right.</p>

<p>The Governor of Mosul, thinking the Englishman
was digging for gold and silver treasure, tried to
stop his work. Sinister rumours spread through
the bazaars that the stranger was interfering with
the graves of their forefathers, and trying to release
all the evil spirits that were chained up in the
mounds. The temper of the population grew very
ugly. Superstition was everywhere rife.</p>

<p>Layard told the Pasha the truth, and that gentleman,
sympathizing with him to his face, put all
sorts of obstacles in his way behind his back. The
worst of the matter was that Layard had no permission
to dig. Until he obtained authority he
knew he would meet with opposition from the
local officials. So he sent an urgent letter to Sir
Stratford Canning, urging the Ambassador to
obtain an order that would smooth away the
opposition of the people in power in Mosul. Luckily
the Ambassador eventually succeeded in getting
an order from the Porte, giving permission to
excavate and to ship any sculptures discovered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
To that order, and to Layard’s own indomitable
will, we owe our wonderful gallery of Assyrian
sculptures now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The sullen murmurs of the mob reached Layard’s
ears, and he rode into Mosul. “You are disturbing
their dead,” he was told. “It will be wiser for
you to stop before they get out of hand.”</p>

<p>Crossing the rickety bridge of boats, Layard rode
along the bank back to Nimroud. With him were
some irregular soldiers, to see that he did not dig
any more. He dared not deliberately run counter
to the wishes of the Pasha, and was not anxious to
risk an outbreak of the mob.</p>

<p>He talked to the Arab in charge of the soldiers
to such good purpose that the man’s tongue wagged
a little more than the Pasha imagined was possible.
It revealed an amusing conspiracy which the Pasha
had hatched to stop further excavations. It was
a trick worthy of the East. The Turkish soldiers
actually dug graves in the dark, in order to point
them out by day as having been violated. “We
have destroyed more real tombs of true Believers
in making sham ones, than you could have defiled
between the Zab and Selamiyah. We have killed
our horses and ourselves carrying those accursed
stones,” the leader confessed to Layard.</p>

<p>Layard quickly hit on a simple plan of winning
the soldiers over. He employed a few to guard
the sculptures he had already uncovered, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
rest turned a blind eye to him if he happened to be
digging instead of copying inscriptions, as he was
supposed to do! The trifling sums he gave the
soldiers for their nominal services were indeed well
spent.</p>

<p>All the time Layard was digging he ran continual
risk of being raided by the Arabs. He was compelled
to organize defences, and more than one
pitched battle took place between the hostile Arabs
and those who guarded the mound of Nimroud.
Often the excavator had to call his diggers out of
the trenches to beat off marauders who coveted
the belongings of the stranger within their gates.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary the way Layard followed
the workings of the Oriental mind. In this direction
he had a unique gift, and with such tact and
judgment did he treat those with whom he came
into contact, that his reputation soon spread abroad
among the Arab tribes. Many of the chiefs held
him in high esteem, and were dominated by his
personality. In those days Layard exercised as
much power among the Arabs, and went among
them as freely, as did Colonel Lawrence during
the Great War. He possessed a determination and
intuition that carried him through everything.
He lived with the Arabs, and liked them.</p>

<p>At his behest great slabs all carved with sculptures
and inscribed with cuneiform characters saw the
light of day once more, after lying beneath the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
soil for three thousand years. There were quaint
figures, beautifully carved with the bodies of men
and the heads of birds, while wings were attached
to the shoulders. These were the ancient gods of
the Assyrians. Winged lions were found partly
destroyed by the fire which had raged over the
palace. Great carvings of campaigns were found
in a similar state.</p>

<p>One day, as he was riding towards the mound
on his return from Mosul, some Arabs galloped up
to him like madmen.</p>

<p>“Hasten, O Bey! hasten to the diggers, for
they have found Nimrod himself. Wallah, it is
wonderful, but it is true. We have seen him with
our eyes. There is no God but God!” they cried,
and turning their horses they pounded away to the
black tents of their tribe.</p>

<p>When Layard got to the trench he saw something
concealed by Arab cloaks and baskets. The diggers
tore the coverings off as he approached, and Layard
beheld the giant head of a sculptured figure buried
up to the neck in the soil. It was a human head,
nearly as tall as a man, and belonging to one of
those fine human-headed winged bulls now in the
British Museum.</p>

<p>One Arab was so terrified of the monster that he
dropped his basket and ran madly to Mosul. He
babbled the most alarming tales of the terror that
the stranger was releasing from the earth, and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>rumours quickly spread through the bazaars.
People for miles around rushed to the scene to
gaze on the idol of the infidels.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The diggers were delighted at the discovery, and
under Layard’s direction they managed to uncover
the top of another head a dozen feet away. The
men worked in a half frenzy, digging away and
running to and fro with the baskets of rubbish like
mad creatures.</p>

<p>To celebrate the find, Layard gave a great feast.
Sheep were killed, musicians made music. Figures
whirled hither and thither in the flicker of the campfires,
dancing wildly over the desert in front of the
goat-hair tents, shouting and leaping until far into
the night.</p>

<p>If by a miracle the clock could have been put
back twenty-five centuries, the simple tents would
have changed to noble palaces and the feasting
Arabs into Assyrian courtiers, with King Sennacherib
drinking out of a golden goblet! As it was,
the Arabs were stamping the past under their feet.</p>

<p>Wonder after wonder was laid bare by the picks
of Layard’s diggers. He found three palaces, all
of different ages, some of which had been built
with slabs of alabaster taken from earlier edifices.
It was plain that the latest had been destroyed by
fire, the vengeful fire which led to the final obliteration
of Assyrian civilization.</p>

<p>In the days of their glory the palaces were magnificent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
standing on massive platforms about 20 feet
high, built of sun-dried bricks, with fine wide
terraces and sculptured halls. The Tigris flowed
by the walls, and mighty winged lions and bulls
guarded the entrances. The ancient sculptors
who carved these figures were no mean artists.
Their art was highly developed, and their skill in
carrying out the details and ornamentation quite
remarkable. They had arrived at a better idea of
perspective than the Egyptians, and their figures
were more lifelike, especially the animals, the
muscles of which were carved very faithfully.</p>

<p>The irrigation works engineered by the ancient
Babylonians and Assyrians were more wonderful
than those carried out in Egypt. The deserts of
Mesopotamia were intersected with an intricate
network of canals. The rivers Tigris and Euphrates
were dammed at intervals, to hold back the waters
and direct them into the canals, feeding the fertile
lands of the country round about. The banks of
the rivers and canals were tended with scrupulous
care, and heavy fines were inflicted on those who
were responsible if the banks gave way.</p>

<p>Mesopotamia in those days was the finest granary
in the world. Here was the Garden of Eden, the
fairest, most fruitful land under the sun, where,
according to the Bible, the story of Man began, the
land of the rivers of which the Bible says: “And
the fourth river is the Euphrates.” Here Adam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
and Eve wandered in the Land of Plenty, until
they were cast out for eating of the Tree of
Knowledge.</p>

<p>Now the smiling land is a waste. When Layard
found these relics of a glorious past, the descendants
of those who builded and carved were wanderers
over the face of the desert, nomads, barely civilized,
living in mud huts and tents. The difference between
the past and present of Mesopotamia is stupendous,
almost incredible.</p>

<p>Before Layard started digging at Nimroud, relics
of Assyria practically did not exist. All that were
known might have been carried about comfortably
in a kit-bag. In a short two years he crowded
discovery on discovery. The past was revealed at
his touch as if by magic.</p>

<p>Even the Arabs realized the wonder of it. “God
is great! God is great!” exclaimed an aged sheik
to Layard. “Here are stones which have been
buried ever since the time of the holy Noah—peace
be with him. Perhaps they were underground
before the Deluge. I have lived on these lands for
years. My father, and the father of my father,
pitched their tents here before me; but they never
heard of these figures. For twelve hundred years
have the true believers been settled in this country,
and none of them ever heard of a palace underground.
Neither did they who went before them.
But lo! here comes a Frank, from many days’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
journey off, and he walks up to the very place and
he takes a stick, and makes a line here, and makes
a line there. ‘Here,’ says he, ‘is the palace;
there,’ says he, ‘is the gate;’ and he shows us
what has been all our lives beneath our feet, without
our having known anything about it. Wonderful!
Wonderful! Is it by books? Is it by magic? Is it
by your prophets that you have learnt these things?
Speak, O Bey! Tell us the Secret of Wisdom.”</p>

<p>The passing of the years has not diminished the
wonder. All the time Layard carried his life in
his hand. He took risks no native of the country
would face. Once he was hunting a wolf, when his
horse slipped and threw him right on top of the
animal he was hunting. Layard picked himself
up, by which time the startled wolf had made off.
Often he rode boldly into the tents of unfriendly
Arabs, and came out unharmed. With his imperious
words he brought insolent chiefs to heel, made them
feel the strength of his personality, and sometimes
the strength of his arm.</p>

<p>He lived a strenuous life, slaving on far into
the dreadful heat of summer, erecting a bower of
branches beside the river to sleep in. The ruins
were infested with scorpions, yet he escaped their
sting. He was not so lucky with the mosquitoes.
Nothing alive could escape these winged pests.
He had attack after attack of malaria. Often he
was so stricken with fever that he found it impossible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
to work at all. In spite of all these drawbacks
and difficulties, he triumphed.</p>

<p>Once when he was investigating the ruins of
Babylon, a Turkish governor presented him with
an unruly lion! Another time he was travelling
over the desert under the escort of an Arab chief,
when a thief stole two of his horses. Taking the
blame on himself, the chief vowed solemnly to
recover the animals, no matter how long it took,
even if it meant going to the ends of the earth.
Layard parted from the chief at the end of his
journey, and gave no further thought to the incident.
For six weeks the chief relentlessly tracked the
stolen horses from place to place, and one day he
quietly rode into Layard’s encampment and left the
two horses for their owner. Without waiting for
thanks, he rode swiftly away.</p>

<p>Extraordinary results were achieved by Layard
with the little money at his command. Certainly
his scale of wages would not now be considered
very extravagant. He paid his diggers sixpence
a day; those who filled the baskets fourpence a
day, the labourers threepence, and the boys twopence.
It seems little enough, but the tent-dwellers
had no rent, rates or taxes to pay, and in
those days they could buy 240 lb. of corn for two
shillings. To many of them, living on the border
line of starvation, a settled wage of two or three
shillings a week meant affluence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Layard himself had a host of duties to perform,
not least of which were sketching the sculptures
as they were revealed and making immediate copies
of all inscriptions found. Such work had to be
done at once for fear the stone crumbled to pieces,
for much of it only lasted a short time after being
uncovered.</p>

<p>At Kouyunjik he found the palace of Sennacherib,
buried 30 feet deep under an accumulation of
debris and soil, so deep, in fact, that it was quite
impossible to open trenches from the top, owing
to the prodigious quantities of soil to be removed.
Layard met this difficulty by driving tunnels, and
the whole mound was in time honeycombed with
his gloomy passages. Occasionally a shaft was
opened to the top to let in light, and the faint
glimmer that filtered down lit up the most astounding
sculptures ever seen by human eyes. Thus was
Nineveh found lying in its grave, so overwhelmed
that Layard had to mine a way into it.</p>

<p>Once Layard gained enormous prestige among
the Arabs, by telling them that the sun would be
eclipsed, and the day grow dark. Sure enough
the sun began to grow dim, and the Arabs, who
thought that devils had caught hold of the planet,
took up all the pots and pans they possessed, and
nearly knocked the bottoms out of them in their
endeavours to frighten the evil spirits away!</p>

<p>The removal of the sculptures from the ruins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
and their safe transport to England, was not the
least of the many problems that Layard had to
solve. The river Tigris was the only highway to
the sea, and as it was too shallow to allow steamers
to steam up to Mosul, it was necessary to build
rafts to float the sculptures down to Basra, where
they could be transhipped to the vessels that were
to take them to England. It needed a deal of
persuasion to induce a native to build a raft big
enough to support the weighty lion and the bull.
The raft was eventually constructed and supported
by six hundred sheep and goat skins, every one
of which had to be blown up by the mouth of the
raftsman and tied securely. It was a task which
must have severely tested the lungs and temper of
the blower.</p>

<p>Layard made his plans carefully. As no timber
was available, a man was sent high up the river
to cut down mulberry trees to make a rude cart
for transporting the bull and lion to the river edge.
The trees were floated down the Tigris, and four
solid wooden wheels a foot thick were cut out of
the trunks and bound with iron. Big beams
formed the body of the cart, and when it was
ready half the population of Mosul crowded to see
the buffaloes drag it over the bridge of boats
spanning the river.</p>

<p>The bull was buried 20 feet deep in the earth.
Layard had no tackle for lifting a weight of fifty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
tons, so his diggers cut a sloping road from the
statue to the edge of the mound, paving it with
planks of wood. The bull, which stood upright,
was to be lowered on its side to a frame of strong
planks. The ropes were placed round the bull,
and over a mighty rock some distance away.
Scores of men slowly paid out the ropes, while the
bull canted over on its side. The statue was about
5 feet from the ground, when all the ropes broke,
the men fell backwards in a heap, and the bull
descended with a crash.</p>

<p>Layard rushed down from his post expecting to
find it shattered, but it proved to be quite uninjured
by its fall. Then the men began to haul the bull over
rollers to the edge of the mound. The noise made
by the onlookers was deafening. They danced and
shouted and behaved like mad people. Gradually
the bull was pulled up the incline until it stood
just above the cart, which had been placed in an
excavation to bring it on a level with the end of
the road. The earth was dug away from under
the bull, and it slowly settled in the cart.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of a few strenuous days
full of troubles. The buffaloes, upon being harnessed
up, refused to pull. Cracking whips and the
shouts of Arabs alike failed to have any effect,
so at last they were taken out, and three hundred
natives caught hold of the ropes and began to drag
the cart to the river. The road had been carefully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
surveyed to make sure that there were no secret
holes in which the villagers were wont to store their
corn, but unluckily one was overlooked. A perverse
fate directed the cart straight to it, and before
any one realized what was happening a wheel
suddenly sank into the covered hole, nearly
capsizing the rough cart.</p>

<p>Spades and timbers were brought to the spot,
and the natives dug and hauled with all their might,
but it was night before the cart was extricated.
The next day saw the long lines of Arabs straining
at the cart once more, and this time progress was
stopped by a bed of soft sand in which the wheels
sank. Not until the third day was the great bull
brought down to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>Here it remained until the melting snows on the
Kurdish mountains made the river rise, and when
there was a sufficient depth of water to float the
bull down to Basra, the final task was undertaken.
A slipway of poplar beams was first of all built
from the bull to the top of the raft. This was
thoroughly greased, just as the slipways are greased
when a battleship is launched, and down this slipway
Layard began to lower the bull. For a moment he
thought all his carefully laid plans were to end in
disaster. The natives hung on to the ropes in their
attempt to check the descent of the bull. It was
too much for them. Getting out of hand, the bull
dropped with a thud on to the raft. The raft gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
a terrific lurch, but luckily it withstood the impact,
and all was well.</p>

<p>Before the bull was embarked, Layard was faced
with the prospect of being defeated by the marauding
Arabs. He ordered all the felts and ropes and
other materials to be brought down to Nimroud on a
raft, but the raft, owing to its late start from Mosul,
was unable to reach the mound before dark, so the
Arabs in charge tied up to the bank to pass the
night. In the middle of the night a raiding party
swarmed down on them and stripped the raft of
everything.</p>

<p>Layard was quickly stirred to action. Directly
he discovered who the culprits were he galloped off
to their camp, and in the very face of the hostile
tribe seized the sheik and carried him off. Under
the lash of Layard’s tongue that worthy soon
repented, and ordered all the missing articles to
be returned.</p>

<p>On another occasion a sudden flood swept away
many Arabs, and sent one of his rafts of sculptures
swirling through a break in the bank into the
swamps, from which they were rescued with the
utmost difficulty. Even in those days lightning
strikes were not unknown, for Layard contended
with one on the part of his Arabs. His sculptures
were all waiting to be placed aboard the raft, when
the Arabs, who knew he dare not miss the spring
floods, told him they were moving camp, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
to induce him to give them more money for the
work. Layard bade them good-bye, and galloped
off into the desert to get helpers from another tribe.
When the strikers came back, finding their bluff
of no avail, they were already superseded.</p>

<p>It is rather a striking commentary on the progress
that has been made in three thousand years, to
know that Layard’s methods in removing the bulls
were almost identical with those of the ancient
Assyrians who placed them in position. One of the
sculptured slabs uncovered by Layard at Kouyunjik,
furnished full particulars of how the ancients
tackled the difficulty of moving such masses.</p>

<p>The original huge block was brought from the
quarry in the hills on rafts supported by skins, just
as the bull was sent down to Basra. It was dragged
ashore by bands of slaves, and the sculptor carved
the block into the form of the man-headed winged
bull, giving the statue five legs, as was the general
practice in Assyria, so that four might be seen
from the side and two from the front. The bull
was then placed on a sledge, something like that
used by the Egyptians for moving similar masses,
and dragged and levered along, the lever used
being a great pole to which ropes were attached
for men to throw their weight upon. A sloping
road was built up to the place where the bulls were
to stand, and up this the statues were gradually
hauled and pushed. The man directing the operations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
of the army of workmen is clearly shown,
though whether he is signalling by blowing on a
trumpet, or shouting through the first megaphone
ever invented, is an open question. He appears
to be using a trumpet, but for aught we know it
might have been something to magnify the voice.</p>

<p>There were carved ivories, Egyptian cartouches,
sculptured sphinxes, to link Babylon and Assyria
with ancient Egypt, to show that intercourse
existed between the two peoples, just as the monuments
of Egypt indicated. Three thousand years
ago letters written in cuneiform characters on clay
tablets were regularly passing to and fro between
the two countries. Apparently at that time the
cuneiform characters could be read equally well
by Egyptians and Babylonians and Assyrians, as
is proved by the Tell el Amarna tablets discovered
in Egypt. Some of the clay letters of those days
are very similar to puppy biscuits in colour, shape
and size; others might easily be mistaken for oblong
tablets of toilet soap.</p>

<p>Whether the civilization of Egypt and that of
Mesopotamia developed simultaneously independent
of each other is a question that is still unsettled.
The general opinion is that the beginnings of all
civilization are to be found in Mesopotamia, but
men who have spent their lives studying ancient
Egypt give precedence to the civilization of the
Nile. These are things which may never be solved.</p>

<p>The evidence seems to indicate that the original
inhabitants of Babylonia were the Sumerians, who
were already possessed of a fair culture. They
were able to read and write, and their writing, in
archaic cuneiform characters, was the writing out
of which the Babylonian cuneiform characters in
the course of time developed. Later variants of it
were the Persian and the Median cuneiform, which
were carved by order of Darius on the rock at
Behistun.</p>

<p>A peaceful, pastoral people, the Sumerians lived
by agriculture and not by war, and they were
swamped by invading Semites, who adopted the
culture of the Sumerians they had conquered.
The conquerors made Babylon the first city of
the world. The same people left their impress on
Egypt, and their characteristics—dark eyes, big
lips and hook noses—are well preserved for us in
the sculptures of Assyria.</p>

<p>The power of Babylon waxed and waned. The
Assyrians, seizing their opportunity, threw off
their bondage, and, sweeping across country,
conquered the walled city of mighty Babylon
itself. Sennacherib razed the city to the ground.
For a time Nineveh blossomed as the first city of
the East. Then came the Babylonians with fire
and sword, and utterly destroyed Assyria and its
civilization.</p>

<p>There are few more remarkable romances than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
that of the young lawyer, who went out to the East
to practise law, and dug up Babylon and Assyria
instead; or of the young English soldier, who

rock at Behistun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Since</span> Layard dug up the vanished cities of
Nineveh and Calah on the banks of the
Tigris three-quarters of a century ago,
many gifted men have followed in his footsteps,
and wielded pick and shovel among the mounds
dotting Mesopotamia. No one coming upon the
utter desolation of Abu Shahrein could imagine that
this great mound of sand, with the ruined brick
tower peeping out at the top, was some six thousand
years ago the flourishing port of Eridu.</p>

<p>Eridu to-day is a dead city, buried under a sea
of sand, yet this desolation marks, so far as we
know, the very beginnings of civilization in Mesopotamia.
Here it was that the Sumerians rose out
of the dim past, with a culture that was far higher
than that of many nations still peopling the world.
They wrote on clay tablets, and had their code of
laws, and traded by ship with distant places.</p>

<p>For long it was thought that Eridu in that far-off
time must have stood upon the seashore. The
evidence that it was a port, and that ships discharged
their cargoes at the quays of the city, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
beyond all dispute. Yet to-day Eridu stands
inland over a hundred miles—the seashore is a long
journey from the one-time seaport.</p>

<p>Men of science strove to solve the seeming contradiction
of a seaport so far inland. They studied
the question very carefully. Measurements were
taken as to the amount of silt deposited by the
Euphrates and the Tigris at their deltas, and it was
proved that in the last six thousand years the area of
land at the mouths of the rivers has been very considerably
extended, indicating that the ancient seashore
has receded inland. The only uncertainty was
whether the rivers had created a new belt of land
over 90 miles wide since the Sumerians lived their
peaceful lives at Eridu of old. It was thought
that the rivers must have accomplished this feat,
and it came to be accepted as the explanation of
why Eridu is now so far away from the coast.</p>

<p>But there is another explanation, and the correct
one. The Sumerians were the people who taught
the Babylonians the art of making canals. In the
days of the Sumerians a system of canals spread
over the country to irrigate the land, and we now
know that the Babylonians and Assyrians obtained
their knowledge of irrigation from the Sumerians,
for the latter were highly capable engineers.</p>

<p>The site of Eridu, about 20 miles from the
Euphrates, stands on the edge of a big depression
in the desert. The skill of the Sumerians in building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
canals is beyond question, and herein lies the
answer to the puzzle of an inland seaport. The
big sandy depression sixty centuries ago was a
lake, and the outlet from the lake was by canal to
the Euphrates, and so to the sea. Eridu of old
was merely the forerunner of Manchester of to-day,
and the ancient people solved the problem of bringing
the galleys to their very doors, in the same way
that the people of Manchester solved the problem
of bringing the steamers into the heart of their
city six thousand years later. Solomon spoke
truly when he said that under the sun there is
nothing new.</p>

<p>Mr. Campbell Thomson, who has done fine work
in Mesopotamia during the past few years on behalf
of the British Museum, was the man who solved
the mystery of ancient Eridu, and definitely proved
that it never stood on the seashore. His Arabs
were digging there, to throw some light on the
vexed question of the past, when they came across
quantities of shells, just as the kitchen middens of
Denmark are marked by the shells of the fish the
ancient peoples ate. The shells at Eridu were
similarly the sole remains of repasts eaten seventy
or eighty centuries ago, perhaps longer.</p>

<p>The average man would shovel such debris aside,
and take no further notice of it, but Campbell
Thomson knew only too well the importance of
trifles in reconstituting the past. He put specimens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
of the shells aside, and brought them to England
with his other finds.</p>

<p>These shells were submitted to an expert, who
was asked to identify them. The expert found that
the shells were those of fresh-water mussels.</p>

<p>Instantly all the theories of those who asserted
that the city once stood on the seashore were refuted.
If Eridu actually stood on the seashore, the mussels
eaten by these primitive inhabitants would have
been salt-water fish. As the shells found were those
of fresh-water fish, they revealed that Eridu stood
on a lake, which the Sumerians undoubtedly connected
up by canal with the Euphrates. In this
way did a simple thing like a mussel shell reveal
another long-lost secret.</p>

<p>About four thousand years ago Eridu was deserted
by man, and the encroaching sands have gradually
silted up the canal and lake. The fact that human
beings ceased to live there so long ago might be
considered a disadvantage to those exploring the
spot, but actually it has proved a tremendous
advantage. Human beings have a habit of destroying
the remains of those who go before them. They
knock down former habitations and rebuild, using
previous materials, until all traces of former peoples
are lost.</p>

<p>At Eridu, Campbell Thomson set his diggers to
cut through the layers of the mound, until they came
to the bottom layer of sand, which had never been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
disturbed by human hands. He found that men of
the Stone Age lived here, men who used flints to
cultivate the soil in the days when the use of metal
was unknown. They cut their corn with sickles
made of clay baked hard, and they were intelligent
and clever enough to make pottery, although the
use of the potter’s wheel was not then known. It
was a pottery of a fine texture, painted with taste
in a number of designs. The hands that made it
were skilled, and the eyes of the potters were true
enough to guide their hands aright.</p>

<p>Only a dozen miles across the desert is Ur of the
Chaldees, where Mr. Taylor, who was British vice-consul
at Basra in the days when Layard was making
a stir, managed to find the remains of the temple of
the Moon God. Seas of sand have been shifted since
on behalf of the British Museum, and the mighty
walls of the temple are now laid bare, while in the
background rises the huge mound covering the city.</p>

<p>The luck of digging was never better exemplified
than at Ur. A Persian and a Babylonian pavement
adjoined, and Mr. Woolley, who was in charge of
the digging operations, states that he was anxious
to know whether there were any traces of a
Babylonian pavement below the Persian pavement.
He describes how he set his diggers to take up
a portion of the Persian pavement, and left them
wielding their picks while he betook himself to
another part of the diggings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>In a little while a small Arab boy came rushing up,
his black eyes aglow with astonishment, words
coming breathlessly from his mouth. “Come quick,
Sahib! Come quick and see what the diggers have
found!” he cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Woolley wasted no time in returning. Directly
he entered the ruins he saw an old cloak spread
on the floor, and lying upon it were gold and silver
ornaments, which had lain undiscovered under the
pavement for twenty-five centuries or more. Giving
a few sharp orders, he cleared the room of the
diggers. Then he undertook further operations
with his own hands, and brought up beads and bits
of gold necklaces, with lapis lazuli and other semi-precious
stones. But the gem of the find was a
beautiful gold statuette of a woman.</p>

<p>Quickly he sent out for boxes and packing
materials, and he was placing the treasure trove
in the boxes, when he was still further astonished.
The Arab in charge of the diggers came up.</p>

<p>“Here, Sahib!” he exclaimed, and began to take
more jewels from his capacious pockets. “I was
afraid to let the men see them, in case they murdered
me for the treasure,” he added simply.</p>

<p>This discovery of ancient treasure follows another
important Mesopotamian find, by Dr. Hall, of the
British Museum, at Tell el Obeid in 1919. Wonderful
life-size heads of lions, most cunningly modelled
in bitumen, were uncovered. The Sumerian artists,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
striving after realism, simulated the fiery eyes and
red tongues of the animals by imitating them in
red jasper. Originally the heads were covered with
fine copper masks, but the metal became corroded
and only the grey-green fragments of the masks
remain. The heads, now among the treasures
of the British Museum, are undoubtedly some
of the finest examples of early Sumerian art in
existence.</p>

<p>Richer treasures still may await the spade of the
excavator, for the deserts of Mesopotamia hide the
relics of many nations; traces of many a hard-fought
battle are swallowed up in the sands. Bits
of the mighty past peep out of Babylon, great gateways
and walls that have been uncovered by the
hands of strangers, men who speak in divers tongues,
even as the slaves who toiled to build the Tower of
Babel.</p>

<p>No longer is there any uncertainty as to the site
of the Tower of Babel. Here in Babylon itself was
the Tower erected that was to reach to Heaven.
The power of Babylon went to the building of the
enormous square tower which, rising terrace on
terrace, dominated the plains for many miles, a
landmark for the whole country-side, and a symbol
of the Strength of Babylon. Thousands of slaves
toiled at making the bricks, thousands more expended
their energies in the building of the gigantic
square platforms which gradually rose above the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
city like a series of boxes, each smaller than that
below.</p>

<p>A flick of the Finger of Time and the mighty tower
toppled, changed into a mountain of broken brick
and debris. Amid the debris, the lower platform of
the tower stood firm, to prove to us that Babel
existed in the days of old.</p>

<p>Here in Babylon Nebuchadnezzar reigned, the city
echoed to the tramp of his armies as he led them
forth to triumph; out on the plains he caused the
golden image to be set up for his subjects to worship;
here followed the ordeal by fire of Shadrach, Meshach
and Abednego, the madness which drove the
monarch to eat grass as the beasts of the field.
Daniel once paced the palaces that stood here in
their glory, found favour with the king, saw the
writing on the wall and prophesied the downfall
of the city when Belshazzar came to the throne.
“God has numbered thy kingdom and finished
it. Thou art weighed in the balance and found
wanting. Thy kingdom is divided and given to the
Medes and Persians,” says the prophet in the Book
of Daniel. The pages of the Bible whisper to us
the history of the world.</p>

<p>Gone is the glory. Only thousands of bricks
stamped with the name of Nebuchadnezzar
remain to call up visions of the pleasure-loving
Babylonians who were swept away by fire and
sword.</p>

<p>The clay tablets of Mesopotamia have told us
many things since Rawlinson stripped them of
their secret; they are pages from the Book of
Mankind. Not the least remarkable discovery
we owe to George Smith, who, going out to the
East on an expedition for the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>,
found among hundreds of the clay books of the
ancients an account of the Flood. He crowded
some fine work into his short life, before succumbing
at Aleppo in 1876 at the age of thirty-six.</p>

<p>Just across the borders in Persia the French
have explored many an ancient site in the quest
for knowledge. De Morgan, in the remaining years
of last century, dug down and down at Susa for
80 feet, until he came to the virgin soil. Throughout
this huge deposit were scattered the relics of many
civilizations, among them a stone which has provided
us with a unique record of the time when
the Sumerians held sway over the land. Inscribed
on this stone is the code of laws made by Hammurabi,
the Sumerian king who reigned about four thousand
years ago.</p>

<p>Throughout the ages history has been repeating
itself. Just as we carried off the Rosetta Stone
from Egypt as one of the spoils of war, so the
people of Susa, setting their heel on Babylon,
conveyed the stone of Hammurabi back in triumph
to Susa. Then the sword of the Assyrians swept
through Susa, and the code of Hammurabi was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
engulfed in the ruins, to await the spade of de
Morgan.</p>

<p>The laws of Hammurabi set forth on his stone
are good laws, and they indicate a people governed
justly. The sun god himself is shown taking the
stylus from the king in order to set down the laws,
implying that the laws were derived from the god
himself.</p>

<p>Instinctively the mind reverts to the vision of
Moses coming down from the mountain, with the
Ten Commandments graven on two tablets of
stone. It may be that some such stone as that of
Hammurabi was itself the foundation of the Ten
Commandments, that the very code of laws on
which all Christian morality is based may one
day reward some ardent excavator. It is impossible
to say. What was unknown to us yesterday may
be revealed to us to-day.</p>

<p>England has cause to be proud of the part played
by Britons in reading the story of mankind. Young
in deciphering hieroglyphics, Rawlinson in reading
cuneiform, and Professor Sayce in mastering the
mysterious Armenian writing of Van—now known
as Vannic—provide a glowing tribute to the intelligence
and determination of the British race.</p>

<p>Mesopotamia, despite the many things to be
found there, has no tombs like those of Egypt to
yield up the secrets of its lost civilizations. The
bodies of the dead were mostly burned. Sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
they were buried in two huge jars placed mouth to
mouth, at other times in a pottery coffin shaped
something like a foot-bath, on which a stone cover
was placed; sites of ancient cemeteries have been
found, revealing strangely shaped pottery coffins,
highly glazed in blue.</p>

<p>These things have told the diggers much, but
the records written on clay bricks and barrel-shaped
cylinders found in the temples and palaces have
yielded more information than has yet been deciphered
or translated. The ancient peoples used
to place baked clay records in a special niche in the
foundations of their buildings, and these have
proved invaluable. The same custom persists to
this day in our own land, for it is a common practice
to place coins and other records under the foundation
stones of modern large buildings of public
importance.</p>

<p>It may truly be said that Layard gave the
impetus to digging in the East, that all the men
working in those parched lands are the disciples
of the Englishman who gave up his best years
to the science he loved. He suffered untold hardships,
his life was often in dire danger, illness
afflicted him, but through it all he went on digging.
He was subjected to bitter attacks and intrigues,
but he countered them to perform his lifework.
The hardships did not weigh with him, the lack
of money for carrying on the work was not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
insuperable handicap, but he was terribly disappointed
at the lack of interest shown by his countrymen
in his discoveries, and by the way his priceless
relics were damaged during transit. Apparently
people thought they were so much rubbish, hardly
worth the taking away.</p>

<p>He entered politics and gained honours as a
diplomat, but his name and his fame will ever rest
on his wonderful work in digging up ancient Assyria
out of the deserts of Mesopotamia.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Romantic</span> as are the Egyptian discoveries,
amazing as the work of Layard remains,
the discovery of Troy ranks as the most
amazing and romantic of all. The excavation of
Troy is, indeed, an epic, interwoven with boyish
dreams, the pictures in a book, dire poverty, and a
gallant struggle for fortune. While Layard’s lifework
was largely inspired by the <cite>Tales of the Arabian
Nights</cite>, Heinrich Schliemann, who excavated Troy,
found his inspiration in Homer.</p>

<p>When the pastor of the hamlet of Neu Buckow
in Mecklenburg Schwerin gazed for the first time
on his new-born son in 1822, he little knew what
strange experiences confronted the boy. A year or
two passed, and the boy grew to love the stories
of the Greek heroes of old that his father used to
pour into his eager ear. Heinrich Schliemann was
enraptured, transported with delight. To him
the stories were real, the deeds which Homer sang
were true. The gift of a book showing the burning
of Troy set all doubts at rest in the boy’s mind. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
saw Troy itself being devoured by flames, the
people fleeing for their lives.</p>

<p>“I’m going to find Troy,” he said to his little
playfellows.</p>

<p>They laughed at him, and he drew aside, rather
hurt, unable to understand why they did not share
his enthusiasm. Then a little girl joined him,
listened to his tales of Troy and of how he was
going to set out one day to find it.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you,” she said.</p>

<p>The little boy remembered. Years afterwards he
returned to her, but she had forgotten and married
another.</p>

<p>Desolation came on the home, and the boy was
driven to face life in a grocer’s shop. For eighteen
hours a day he expended his boyish strength in the
services of the grocer, sweeping out the shop,
cleaning the windows, doing menial tasks for
which he had not the slightest inclination. While
customers were demanding salt herrings of him
at the counter, he was dreaming of Helen of Troy,
and as he patted the butter his thoughts followed
the adventures of Ulysses, saw him sailing ’twixt
Scylla and Charybdis, heard the sirens calling to
his hero.</p>

<p>It was a desperately hard life for the boy. His
spirit rebelled, but he could do nothing to escape.
He was the creature of circumstance, a grocer’s
boy who dreamed of Homer while serving a litre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
of milk. Continual contact with customers who
were rough, crude, uneducated, gradually drove
from his mind the little Latin and learning of earlier
days. Loving knowledge, he yet had no time to
acquire it. What opportunity was there for a
boy to learn while working eighteen hours a day?</p>

<p>Schliemann was one of the shop slaves of last
century. His life was sheer drudgery all the time,
just drudgery and a few hours of sleep for the
exhausted frame; no pleasure, no holidays, only
work.</p>

<p>Through all his misery sometimes flashed the
memories of the happy days when his father used
to delight him with the tales of Greek heroes. Somehow,
in spite of everything, he retained a glimmer
of hope, although he could see no way out of his
environment. From dawn to long after dark he
was selling food for the body and craving food for
the mind. That childish picture of the burning of
Troy was as a beacon to him, often nearly overwhelmed,
but always flickering up again in his
imagination. Buried deep down in him was still
the determination to find Troy.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk one day when a drunken
miller lurched into the shop, and suddenly began
to recite in Greek some passages from Homer.
Schliemann was transfixed with amazement. The
meaning of the words was lost to him, but the
beauty of the lines, their music, entered his soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“Say it again,” he said eagerly to the miller.</p>

<p>The miller repeated the passages, and Schliemann,
feeling in his pocket for coppers, bought a glass of
spirits to reward the drunkard.</p>

<p>“Again,” said Schliemann, and gave the man
another glass of spirits to induce him to repeat the
lines.</p>

<p>Even then the grocer’s boy was not satisfied.
He fumbled in his pocket and produced his last
coppers, the only wealth he owned in the world,
and with them bought a third glass of spirits so
that he might hear the lines from Homer once more.
Imagine the tragedy of it, a grocer’s boy giving
everything he possessed just to hear a drunken
miller—the son of a clergyman—recite Homer
to him in Greek. One clergyman’s son a grocer,
weeping because he loved Homer and could not
speak Greek, the other clergyman’s son drinking
to drown his misery because he knew Greek and
Homer, and was condemned to be a miller.</p>

<p>Bitter tears flowed down the boy’s face. He
hungered for learning, but his intellect was starved.
Every night, utterly wearied with the day’s work,
he went down on his knees beside his bed, and
prayed to God that he might live to learn Greek.
To the poor grocer’s boy, life could hold no greater
boon.</p>

<p>What at the time seemed his crowning misfortune
proved in the end to be his way of escape.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Straining one day to lift a big cask, a sharp fit of
coughing brought his exertions to a sudden end.
There was blood on his lips and despair in his
heart. Work in the shop was no longer possible.</p>

<p>The lad knew not what to do. Ill, without money,
he drifted to Hamburg. No one would employ
him in his weak state, and at last in desperation
he shipped as a cabin boy in a vessel bound for
Venezuela. A storm brought the ship to disaster,
and for hours the crew faced death in an open boat
before being cast on the Dutch coast.</p>

<p>The darkest days in Schliemann’s life followed,
days when he was compelled to beg to keep body
and soul together. A poorly paid situation in an
office revived hope in the breast of the shipwrecked
lad. Renting a garret at eighteenpence a week, he
nearly starved himself in order to buy books for
study. Less than a shilling a day sufficed to pay
his rent and keep him alive.</p>

<p>No longer could his hunger for education be
denied. Always he had a book with him, every
minute found him studying. If he waited in a
shop, out would come his book from his pocket;
had he to walk on an errand down the street, then
he walked with an open book in his hand. In six
months he learned English; during the next six
months he mastered French.</p>

<p>He was mad to learn. His whole soul craved for
knowledge. All the unknown powers of his undeveloped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
brain began to awaken. He possessed
a genius for learning languages which was almost
unparalleled. With every language he learned,
the next came easier. In the following six months
he mastered Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish and
Italian. His memory, which previously was bad,
became remarkably retentive, as is proved by this
wonderful feat.</p>

<p>He did not stop to rest. His thoughts turned
to Russian, and his method of learning it was not
without a touch of humour. A better-paid post
provided money to pay a teacher, so he scoured
the city on his quest. He hunted here, there and
everywhere. In all Amsterdam was not a single
teacher of Russian, not a soul who understood a
word of the language.</p>

<p>Schliemann, thrown back on himself, unearthed
an old Russian grammar and dictionary and began
to study the language alone. In less than a week
he learned the alphabet, and soon he was writing
simple exercises in Russian. Somehow his progress
did not please him, he felt the monotony of working
alone. To lessen this monotony he hit on the plan
of hiring some one to listen to his Russian recitations
for the sum of sixpence a night. Every evening he
declaimed in Russian to the listener. The listener,
understanding not a word, sat and was shouted at
by Schliemann.</p>

<p>As the listener was paid to listen, he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
object. It was otherwise, however, with Schliemann’s
landlords. They were not paid to listen,
and they objected strongly to the noise their lodger
made, so strongly that he was asked to find other
lodgings because of the annoyance he created. If
the landlords thought to stop his studies in this way,
they were mistaken. Twice Schliemann was driven
to new lodgings, but he calmly continued his studies,
and in six weeks was writing letters in Russian.</p>

<p>By the time he was twenty-four, this amazing
young man was sent on business to Russia, and
within a year he was starting in business there for
himself, fully determined to make a fortune so
that he could travel and realize the dreams of his
childhood.</p>

<p>The remarkable thing is that the man who
revered Greece and everything Greek should spend
his energies in learning so many other tongues to
the exclusion of the language of his beloved Homer.
The truth is that he, who had the gift of languages,
was afraid to learn Greek. He dared not trust
himself to begin. The desire implanted by the
befuddled miller had grown stronger with the years,
and Schliemann, knowing the potent spell the
language cast over him, feared that once he began
to study Greek, he would neglect his business
altogether, and never make the fortune which was
to set him free to wander in the land of Homer.</p>

<p>He threw himself into his business just as he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
thrown himself into his studies, and for years all
his energies were concentrated to one end, that of
making money. Once, when Memel was burned
down, he gave himself up as ruined. His fortune
was locked up in a cargo of indigo at the docks, and
all the dock warehouses were a smoking mass.
Hours later he learned that as the stone warehouses
were choked so full of goods, his indigo had been
stored in a wooden shed some distance away, and
the direction of the wind had saved the shed. It
was an ill wind for Memel, but it trebled Schliemann’s
fortune.</p>

<p>In ten short years his industry and exceptional
ability, coupled with the Crimean War, brought
him the fortune he had planned. He, a young man
of thirty-five, was free to order his life as he chose.
He gave himself up wholeheartedly to learning the
tongue of his Greek heroes, and in six weeks Greek
was no longer an unknown language to him. Within
three months he was reading his beloved Homer in
the original tongue.</p>

<p>Schliemann, who had the phenomenal ability to
learn a language in six weeks, wandered far over
the world, acquiring languages as souvenirs of the
lands he visited, just as modern travellers pick up
souvenirs in shops. But in the end his travels
brought him to Greece.</p>

<p>Where other people regarded the songs of Homer
as mere legends, Schliemann never doubted their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
basic truth. While many wondered whether Troy
ever existed at all, Schliemann in his innermost
heart knew that Troy had been a real city. The
wonderful work of Layard fired his imagination,
and gradually the idea formed in his mind that if
Layard had succeeded in digging up the lost city
of Nineveh he himself might find Troy with a
spade.</p>

<p>In 1870, filled with the knowledge of years of
study, he came to the desolate Hill of Hissarlik
standing on the Plain of Troy, a short distance
from the Dardanelles. He climbed the hill, feeling
sure that beneath his feet were buried the remains
of the city of his heroes. Scholars laughed at his
enthusiasm, ridiculed the idea that Hissarlik could
possibly have been Troy. If Troy ever existed,
the one thing certain, they averred, was that it
could not possibly have been at Hissarlik. To
most people Troy was merely a myth, a city of the
gods created by Homer himself.</p>

<p>Countering the ridicule with cold logic, Schliemann
decided to set all doubts at rest by the test
of excavation. For £300 he bought the greater
part of the site from the Turkish owners and, after
many vexatious delays, began digging into the side
of the mighty hill in 1871. He was desperately
keen to clear up the mystery of Troy. He set his
labourers to work, cutting the secret out of the
heart of the hill. Men, at Schliemann’s bidding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
began to run away with the hill of Hissarlik in
wheelbarrows.</p>

<p>Schliemann’s energy was remarkable, his driving
force irresistible. From dawn till dark he was on
the site. His wife, a Greek lady, was as enthusiastic
as her husband, so enthusiastic, indeed, that she
and her maid took picks and spades and dug trenches
and made discoveries for themselves.</p>

<p>So long as Schliemann was eating into the hill,
he was happy. His greatest enemies were feast
days and rainy days, for in wet weather it was
impossible to work, and on feast days the Greeks
positively refused to work—a cart-load of money
would not win a day’s labour from them. So on
these days Schliemann sat down and wrote up his
discoveries.</p>

<p>He laid bare great walls, and as his diggers
burrowed into the hill they found others immediately
below the first, the lower walls buried in soil and
rubbish. Schliemann was amazed. The Hill of
Hissarlik was the most wonderful hill in the world.
All the history of thousands of years was concentrated
on this one spot, heaped up there by the
hands of men long dead.</p>

<p>The deeper he dug, the more he marvelled.
Here was city heaped on city, civilization on
civilization. The city of one people had been overwhelmed
and covered with debris, then on top of
the buried city another people had erected their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>own dwellings, probably not knowing nor caring
what lay under their feet. So it went on here for
centuries, for thousands of years, back into the
past to the Greeks, to the Trojans, to an earlier
race linked with Crete.</p>

FAMOUS CITY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The original hill increased in size with the
centuries. As the cities were overwhelmed, so the
hill grew until in places it was 50 feet higher than
the virgin soil on which the first dwellings were
founded. As the height increased, so did the
length and breadth. Foot by foot the debris of
vanished peoples accumulated on the hill, foot by
foot the rubbish fell, until in one direction Schliemann
found the hill 250 feet longer than it had
originally been, while in another place he found
that 150 feet had been added!</p>

<p>And in all this mountain of debris Schliemann
came across relics, hundreds of them, thousands
of them, walls and pieces of pottery and stone
battleaxes, with copper nails used by ladies as
hair-pins. His industry was astounding. He
marked the depth at which everything was found,
paid rewards to the finders. If a piece of pottery
with an inscription turned up, the man who turned
it up received additional pay. The diggers, anxious
to make all they could, were more interested in
the money than in the work. Some tried to
deceive him by scratching inscriptions on bits of
pottery. A magnifying glass soon laid the frauds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
bare, and the finders, instead of getting extra pay,
were fined for their deceit. The old diggers soon
realized that it was useless to attempt to deceive
Schliemann in this way, and new diggers were not
long in learning the same lesson.</p>

<p>The hill was like an anthill, men scurrying about
with wheelbarrows, men digging away. At times
Schliemann had one hundred and fifty labourers
at work, with horses and carts. Once his men
were striving to lever down a mighty wall of earth
which long resisted their utmost efforts. No
sooner was it down than another wall collapsed
without warning on some of the diggers. Schliemann
saw the catastrophe with horror. He rushed
down and began to dig with all his strength, while
the cries and groans of the buried men fell on his
ears. Fortunately the timbers shoring up the work
slipped in such a way that they kept the weight
off the imprisoned men, who were eventually dug
out little the worse for their premature burial.</p>

<p>Not without reason did Homer call Ilium the
“windy place,” as Schliemann realized when he
experienced to the full the awful blasts that swept
over the plain. Sometimes the temperature dropped
suddenly and the wind came through their wooden
houses and nearly froze them to death. The only
way it was possible to keep warm on these occasions
was to go into a sheltered trench and work at the
face of the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of tons of debris were
shifted in driving a great road like a railway cutting
with huge sloping embankments through the hill.
In one trench Schliemann fought his way through
two walls 10 feet thick, and in a little while came
to two more walls 6 and 8 feet thick. Mighty
blocks of stone had to be wrenched out and broken
up before they could be carted away. The Greeks,
coveting this stone for building purposes, quickly
carted it away, but they were too indolent to assist
Schliemann in breaking it up.</p>

<p>Just as a lady cuts into a cake of many layers,
so he cut into the Hill of Hissarlik, and instead of
finding one city he found seven, built one on top
of another, with layers of burned ashes and debris
between to mark the calamities which had wiped
them out. In some places the ashes were from
5 to 10 feet thick, irrefutable proof of the way fire
and sword had played about this desolate hill
throughout the ages. He found his city of Troy
at a depth of about 30 feet, the city which flourished
three thousand years ago before the Greeks took
it by subterfuge. He laid bare the ancient gate,
and while cutting a trench through a wall near
the gate, his delighted eyes caught their first
glimpse of the great Trojan treasure, golden cups
and jugs and silver goblets, some of the gold cups
weighing a pound, with silver cups twice as heavy.
Here were necklaces and other jewels all hurriedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
thrust into a hole in the town wall as if some one
were fleeing with the treasure when he was overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Quickly Schliemann sent his men to breakfast
before they knew of the discovery, and very carefully
he cut out the treasure from the debris with his
knife, giving it to his wife, who, concealing it
beneath her cloak, hurried with it to their little
wooden house on the hill. At any moment the
great wall above him might have collapsed and
killed him, but he was too excited to heed the risk.</p>

<p>For three years Schliemann dug into the Hill of
Hissarlik, finding ruined temples, laying bare
castles and towers and city walls. When he published
his discoveries, a storm of criticism arose
among men of science. They laughed him to scorn,
refused to believe him, to accept his evidence.
They considered that he was utterly wrong, that
his enthusiasm for Homer had led him astray and
betrayed him into error.</p>

<p>The storm of controversy raged on while Schliemann
went to Mycenæ and dug up an even more
wonderful treasure than that of Troy, finding the
bodies of ancient kings buried in golden masks
and with golden armour about them. It was a
dazzling discovery of the wealth of the Mycenæan
age, and Schliemann proved that his interests
were purely scientific by presenting it all to the
museum at Athens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Not until the great English statesman, William
Ewart Gladstone, arose and championed Schliemann,
did men of science begin to realize that they were
wrong and Schliemann was right. Thus the poor
German grocer boy, who had listened with tears in
his eyes to a drunken miller reciting passages from
Homer, lived to lay bare the city of his dreams with
a spade. Working in direct opposition to the
opinions of science, he dug up the city of Troy in
the very place where he knew it must be, and where
scientists said it could not possibly have stood.</p>

<p>The discovery of Troy was the triumph of
Schliemann’s faith and genius.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">Science,</span> which began by doubting, finished
by honouring Schliemann for his remarkable
discoveries. Multitudes had gazed on
the desolate Hill of Hissarlik, the Turks had long
quarried it for stones for new buildings, but none
except Schliemann suspected the wonders that lay
concealed beneath the great mound. Even he was
puzzled at first to read all the records aright, but
gradually the evidence was sifted out and the story
was made plainer. In all, Schliemann recovered
from the site a hundred thousand relics, every one
of which was photographed, drawn and catalogued
with the depth at which it was found.</p>

<p>The peculiar thing was that Schliemann learned,
as those who have worked in Egypt have also discovered,
that the deeper he dug and the farther
he went back, the more artistic did the pottery
become; that the potter’s art decayed through the
later ages until it was quite crude. Some of the
wonderful golden cups he found, weighing upwards
of a pound, were beaten into shape by the goldsmith,
others were actually cast gold. He was pleasantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
surprised one day when, knocking down a great
thick piece of what he imagined to be fused copper
wire, the wire broke apart and the silver and golden
bracelets of which it was composed fell on the floor,
some of them melted together by the heat of a
mighty fire.</p>

<p>He found weights made of burnt clay, with seals
of similar material, and quaint objects of pottery
on which were inscriptions in an unknown writing.
There were Egyptian and Assyrian relics, with relics
of Crete, and a fine sculpture of Apollo driving the
horses of the Sun, which pointed to the remarkable
uprising of art in Greece, when Greek sculptors
produced the most beautiful statues the world has
ever seen, works which modern sculptors acknowledge
as the masterpieces of all time. The building
of the Parthenon at Athens in the time of Phidias,
two thousand four hundred years ago, saw Greek
art at the height of its glory, with artists doing finer
work than has ever been done before or since.</p>

<p>The glory of Greece faded, but the Parthenon
still lifted its noble columns to the skies and withstood
the ravages of time. Loving hands designed
it, skilled fingers shaped the stones, modelled the
exquisite statues that decorated it. That which
man had builded so wonderfully, those who were
blind to beauty wantonly destroyed. Time and
weather caressed the marbles, but the hand of man
sought their destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>About the time that the Rosetta Stone was
brought to light at Fort St. Julian to reveal the
mystery of hieroglyphics, Lord Elgin, the British
Ambassador to Constantinople, made up his mind
to try to save a few of the priceless fragments
scattering the Acropolis at Athens. For years the
Turks had been using the Parthenon as a quarry,
carting off the stones and building them into their
houses. The vandalism of the Turks was almost
incredible. They ripped out the stones of the most
glorious building the world has ever seen and built
them into their forts; they fired their guns at the
sculptures in a fury of sheer destruction. They
broke off arms and legs and gave them to passing
travellers. Anything and everything they could
do to obliterate the glory of ancient Greece was
done.</p>

<p>Lord Elgin, knowing how much had vanished
within living memory, knew that in a few years
little would be left, for the Turks delighted in
destroying those things which the Christian infidels
came so far to see. He treated with the Turkish
authorities, he even went so far as to gain the ear
of the Sultan’s mother, and in the end he was
granted an order to dig and remove any stones and
sculptures which he desired.</p>

<p>A staff of artists went to Athens on behalf of Lord
Elgin to sketch the ruins on the Acropolis. Athens,
however, was a long way from Constantinople,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
and the power of the Porte diminished as the distance
from the capital increased. The local officials,
reading the order in their own way, would only
let the artists enter the Acropolis upon payment
of £5 a day. For the greater part of a year Lord
Elgin paid this exaction without demur. Money
was nothing to him so long as he saved these beautiful
relics of the past.</p>

<p>Over four hundred men were employed in collecting
what was to be saved of the fragments which,
shattered and smashed, were still of unique beauty.
They dug among the gigantic heaps of ruins for
remains of marbles. Scaffolding was erected to
take down some of the matchless figures in the
frieze. Stones were taken out of the forts and
replaced with less valuable stones.</p>

<p>A rumour that some marbles had been built into
a Turkish house reached Lord Elgin’s ears, and at
once he sent to Constantinople for special permission
to pull down the house. After much delay
and a great deal of trouble, coupled with the expenditure
of a considerable sum in bribes, the permission
was granted. Lord Elgin set his men to
work, and stone by stone the house was pulled down.
No trace of marbles could be found.</p>

<p>Not until the house was entirely destroyed did
the one-time owner calmly stroll up to the ruins
and announce that all the marbles had been ground
down to make mortar for his dwelling. It seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
incredible, yet it is literally true that the greatest
works of art ever created by man were pulverized
to make cement for a workman’s house. The
incident was but one of a series of such acts of
vandalism. On another occasion a Turk, getting at
some of the statues, smilingly knocked the head off
one of the figures and deliberately smashed it to
bits because the people, whom he called Christian
dogs, admired it.</p>

<p>The fragments of sculptures that remained were
gathered up by loving hands and packed into cases.
But there was much delay before they reached
England. Lord Elgin, owing to our war with
France, became a prisoner in Paris, and the cases
containing the sculptures lay neglected in Malta
and other places.</p>

<p>Some of the Elgin marbles which now grace the
British Museum were for a period at the bottom of
the sea. The <em>Mentor</em>, on which they were shipped,
was wrecked at Cerigo in the Grecian Archipelago,
and went down in 60 feet of water. For three
years a fight was waged to rescue these treasures
from the sea-bed, and only after considerable
difficulty were all the cases eventually recovered
by divers.</p>

<p>While the art world acclaimed Lord Elgin for
having saved some of the most beautiful statues
in the world, the Government looked upon him
askance. He spent a fortune of about £80,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
in acquiring the wonderful collection, and it was
questioned whether the sculptures were really his
private property. Directly he gave the State the
opportunity of acquiring them on behalf of the
public, the Government began to haggle about the
price as though the sculptures were an everyday
article of commerce such as tea or sugar. A Commission
was appointed to go into the matter and
many people were examined, giving the impression
that Lord Elgin, in expending his private fortune
to rescue the priceless sculptures of Phidias from
the destroying hands of the Turks, had committed
some grave crime. Famous sculptors like John
Flaxman, R.A., and Joseph Nollekins, R.A., went
before the Commission and spoke enthusiastically
about the beauty of the ancient marbles that had
once graced the Parthenon; artists like Sir Thomas
Lawrence sang their praises; the President of the
Royal Academy said the marbles were incomparable.</p>

<p>All the time the question of value kept cropping
up. “How much do you think they are worth?”
the artists were asked. The artists did not know.
How could they say? It was impossible for them
to fix a price on beautiful things they considered
priceless.</p>

<p>But it was not impossible for the Government.
The value of the Elgin Marbles was set down at
£35,000. The wonderful sculptures which many
American millionaires to-day would pay anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
to obtain were valued then at £35,000. The nation
owes much to Lord Elgin for acquiring from the
ruins of Athens these matchless relics of the time
when Athens was the first city of the world and
Greek art was blooming in all its beauty.</p>

<p>Lord Elgin rescued the glories of Greece that
were still visible, but Schliemann nearly three
quarters of a century later had the extraordinary
insight and genius to delve into the dim past before
Greece was, before Troy was a nation, back to the
misty beginnings of that ancient race whose
writings even now we are unable to read.</p>

<p>The puzzling characters inscribed on the pottery
dug up by Schliemann gave him the clue where to
look for the earliest traces of that race. With rare
judgment, amounting to genius, he pointed to
Knossos, in Crete, as the seat from which the
Mediterranean civilization sprang.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap no-indent"><span class="upper-case">On</span> the map of the world, Great Britain is
small. That men should go forth from
this little island and win their way in so
many distant lands, that this island people should
wield such power over the earth, that they should
venture into the unknown places and bring vast
areas under the dominion of England, seems incredible.
If we were not aware that this is the
literal truth, we should find it hard to believe, we
might even feel inclined to doubt it. The fact
that the mighty British Empire has all sprung from
this little island in the North Sea is one of the most
astounding things in the world.</p>

<p>In olden times it was thought that all the world
centred round the Mediterranean Sea, that the
earth consisted only of those lands bordering the
Mediterranean. In bygone days, long before the
dawn of history, it is possible that Crete dominated
the known world of that day just as the Island of
Great Britain dominates the world of our own
day.</p>

<p>The British Empire is tangible proof of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
one little island can do. There is no reason why
Crete should not have done the same in the past,
why that little island set in the vivid blue of the
Mediterranean should not have influenced all the
lands on the Mediterranean shore. We do not
know. We cannot say. We have learned much,
but more remains to be unravelled from the tangled
skein that Time has woven in Crete.</p>

<p>As already mentioned, Schliemann, bringing all
the knowledge he had gained in his amazing
excavations at Troy, at Mycenæ and other places,
to bear on the subject of the origin of the
Mediterranean civilization, placed his finger on
Knossos as the centre whence it sprang. His
uncanny instinct was once more right. He
wandered about the lonely places of Crete, still
with faith in the Homer who led him to discover
Troy, feeling sure that at Knossos he would
find the fabled palace of King Minos, but death
prevented him from making the biggest discovery
of all.</p>

<p>The work that the German excavator left undone
was taken up by Sir Arthur Evans. Unfolding his
tent on the barren site of Knossos, Sir Arthur Evans
set his diggers to work. They dug diligently, scanning
every spadeful of earth for traces of man.
They excavated a yard of soil, 6 feet, 10 feet,
wielding pick and shovel, carrying the debris away
in baskets. They found many things, broken jars,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>decorated pottery, but most important of all
were the clay tablets inscribed with the puzzling
writing of the Minoans.</p>
<br>

A NEW AND HIGHLY DEVELOPED CIVILIZATION, WITH A WRITING WHICH CANNOT YET BE READ</p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Still they went on, getting deeper and deeper,
until the pick of a digger struck a paving stone.
They shovelled the rubbish away and disclosed
another stone, then another. At last Sir Arthur
Evans had reached the stone pavement of a
palace.</p>

<p>Excavations were continued, and gradually the
throne-room of the Palace of Knossos was bared once
more to human eyes, after lying under the debris
for countless generations. Here were the stone
seats arranged round the walls for the councillors,
here was the throne on which sat the king who laid
tributary on all the lands about the Mediterranean,
a stone throne, hollowed in the seat to give comfort,
with a stone back carved in a series of six curves
rising to a half-circle at the top, the solid block comprising
the seat carved at the front to indicate legs.
Here in this ancient palace he held audiences, sent
his messengers forth in their galleys to claim tribute
at Athens, issued his decrees.</p>

<p>“Go,” he said, and they went.</p>

<p>And when after feasting he desired amusement
and relaxation, he would beckon his henchman.
“Fetch me maidens to dance and sing,” he would
say, and there would be the sound of twanging strings
and the pitter-patter of little naked feet on the stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
floor, feet with toes pink as rosebuds, lithe limbs,
flowing draperies.</p>

<p>And the king, feasting his eyes on the beauty of
his dancers, would dream of the youths and maidens
even then aboard his galleys on their way from
Athens to Crete, the youths and maidens who were
the yearly tribute.</p>

<p>The hot sun, beating down on the well-tended
vineyards, drew the nectar of the earth to the
grapes, brushed them with a delicate bloom ere they
fell beneath the feet of the winepressers to yield the
juice that made the feasters merry. The blossom
of the olive groves was succeeded by tiny green
olives which swelled in the heat until they were
ready to yield their rich oil which was so welcome
to the people of other lands. Artists worked
happily on the plaster walls, laying on their colours
to delight the eye, potters kneaded their clay until
it was as butter under the ball of the thumb. The
people spun and sewed and draped their bodies in
comely garments. But most of all they valued
health, realized the necessity for adequate drainage.</p>

<p>Did they become too civilized, these ancient
people? Did they grow lazy in their luxury, disinclined
to work? Who knows! Perhaps it was
so. At any rate, desolation swept over them and
blotted them out, just as the cities on the site of
Troy were blotted out again and again.</p>

<p>We can imagine the galleys of the invaders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
approaching the rocky coasts, the cries of alarm running
through the palaces and over the island, the
invaders springing ashore, fierce, strong, hard, not
softened by too much civilization, relying on their
own strength and weapons for sustenance, not upon
the tribute exacted from other lands. Muscular
arms that had thrust the galleys through the
Mediterranean, dropped the sweeps and caught up
weapons as the keels grounded. The sea curled
about the legs of the invaders as they dropped over
the prow and swarmed ashore. Fighters, every
one, asking no quarter, giving none, seeking plunder
with the sword, valuing other lives not at all and
their own but little.</p>

<p>See the women shrinking into the corners of the
palaces, eyes full of fear, sensing approaching doom;
men shouting and gasping, the invaders sweeping
forward and cutting them down. A semi-barbarous
people conquering a civilized people, cold iron superseding
bronze, uncultured men with superior
weapons triumphing over culture with inferior
weapons.</p>

<p>Long, long ago something like this happened in
Crete; the palaces of the ancient people were toppled
about their ears and palaces and people vanished
into oblivion.</p>

<p>Gaze on another scene thousands of years later.
Absolute desolation on the hill of Kephala. No
sound of music nor pitter-patter of pink feet on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
naked stones, only the song of the breeze; no sign
of palaces, conquered and conquerors alike swept
into the gulf of Time; only the same blue sea a mile
or two away singing its eternal song on the same
rocky coast.</p>

<p>Men are swinging picks into the bosom of the earth,
making great gashes and gaps in the hill, picking over
the loosened rubbish, throwing it into baskets and
carrying it away. An easy movement of the arm
sends the contents of the basket sliding down the
face of the dump, and the black-haired labourer
turns back for another load.</p>

<p>Suddenly a digger glimpses something amid the
heap of rubbish loosened by the point of the pick.
He stoops like a hawk to its prey and brushes aside
the soil with his fingers, scrapes carefully about the
object, and in a minute has it free.</p>

<p>It is merely a piece of yellow pottery with red
decorations. Almost before the finder has had time
to look at the fragment, a man scrambles down to
him and, taking the fragment, carefully removes
all traces of soil.</p>

<p>Keen eyes scrutinize the little piece of pottery,
and thoughts go crowding through the brain.
Visions of Egypt leap up, of a similar fragment
found in a tomb far over the blue sea to the south,
past the age-old Pyramids and the modern wonder
of Assouan. Back and back thoughts fly through
the ages, back to the earliest kings who swayed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>the earliest communities in the Nile Valley, all
because of a fragment of burnt earth, bits of pottery,
links in the Eternal Chain of Time, binding together
in some unknown way Egypt and Crete. Most of
the links are missing, but who knows how and when
the pick and shovel of the seeker after truth may
come across them?</p>

<br>

<p>Once more let us glimpse that hill in Crete. The
diggers are gesticulating, running about. Carefully
they dig and loosen the soil about another object.
A band of carved stone comes to light; it is a
curved band, and as they work about it ever so
carefully, they find it is part of a cylinder buried
deep in the earth. They work excitedly, removing
the earth, digging down until they reveal a mighty
stone jar, a jar big enough for a man to stand
upright in, a jar which the ancients used as a store.
It is the giant forerunner of those tiny canisters
to be found in the modern pantry, canisters for
storing tea and coffee and sugar and rice.</p>

<p>Deeper yet dug Sir Arthur Evans, until he had
penetrated to nearly twice the depth of the floor
of the Palace of Knossos, until he was nearly 40
feet below the surface. Here were stone implements,
the scrapers and knives of the unknown
people who first dwelt in this island in the Mediterranean.
And through all the different strata
he found relics of man, relics by which it was
possible to trace the rise of civilization in Crete,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
from stone to copper, and copper to bronze and
bronze to iron.</p>

<p>But the biggest find of all are the stones and clay
tablets and seals with their hieroglyphic and script
writing. For years Sir Arthur Evans has puzzled
over them, tried to solve the mystery of this strange
writing. The finest scholars of the world have
racked their brains for the clue to the mystery
writing. There is the writing, but we cannot read
it. The key is lost.</p>

<p>Still the search for it goes on, and some day Sir
Arthur Evans will surely achieve his crowning
triumph and solve the riddle of the pictographs
and script of Crete. What we may learn then
about the origins of our own civilization, nobody
can foretell. The inscribed stones and clay tablets
of Crete have yet to yield up their secret.</p>

<p>For years Sir Arthur Evans has laboured in
Crete, finding the money to move mountains of
soil so that light may be thrown on the past. Discoveries
of the highest importance have followed
his excavations, for he has proved with pick and
spade that here in this little island flourished a
civilization almost undreamed of till the present
century, a civilization maybe as old as that of Egypt
and Mesopotamia, a civilization that flourished at
least five thousand years ago, that endured for
ages before the Phœnicians launched their galleys
on the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps in the years to come the researches of
those who are working in the desert places will
make the origin of these early civilizations clearer,
and we may be able to assign to each its proper
place in the Story of Mankind.</p>
